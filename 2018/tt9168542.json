Our five young Kiddets all learn together through play, and each has an area of special interest such as leadership, health and safety, mechanics, science and the arts. This delightful group of inquiring minds learn from each other and from SpottyWot and DottyWot, who are based on planet Earth. The show celebrates the joy of discovery, learning through play and demonstrates the positive values that are the building blocks of a true and enduring friendship.",
