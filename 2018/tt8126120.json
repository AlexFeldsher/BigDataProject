But when the new government is formed and Hugo is overlooked for office, he realizes that he has been used.

Nor is it less chaotic on the home front, as he is juggling his love life between two mistresses and his long-suffering wife and mother of his children. When Napoléon seizes power and his sons are jailed for insurrection, Hugo insists that his wife and daughter leave Paris, where he remains, devoting himself wholeheartedly to the resistance.
