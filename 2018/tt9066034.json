            "Joy Morris's quiet and controlled life is about to be turned up-side-down:Without preparation or predisposition, Joy is unexpectedly plucked from her world of grammar and prepositions in the back office of News Today and summoned to step into the position of the media corporation's sexy and adventurous lifestyle guru Flora Hunter. As the \"Happy Hunter\", every week Flora embarks on an adventure into the wild and wacky activities that purport to bring excitement, spontaneity and happiness into the lives of its consumers. She reports back in her super-cool, laconic style and the whole venture has proved enormously successful: alternative businesses, treatments and therapies know that Flora's word can make or break their credibility rating.Tragically though, over the previous weekend, Flora cashed in some dodgy vouchers for a facial touch-up that has left her searching for her nostrils and unable to face the cameras.Joy is as surprised as anyone to be summoned to a meeting with News Today's panicked executives, the formidable Jeffrey and Audrey:Joy is literally the last person you would choose as a replacement. Like literally the last. But she is spurred on to agree to it because she has just seen a social media post of her ex Aidan with some hot new girl. And maybe this new venture can prove to Aidan that she is not the rigid and controlling person he suspects her of being. And, with any luck, she may even be able to prove that to herself.Joy's unpolished pieces turn out to be a hit with the News Today subscribers. And as she ventures into the strange and hair-raising world of therapeutic wrestling, internet dating, group therapy and life-changing abseiling, Joy comes to realize that her professional journey may be able help her negotiate her personal dramas.Finding Joy is a warm, funny and irreverent look at modern Ireland and how we each try to find meaning in our lives in a world where old certainties are gone."
