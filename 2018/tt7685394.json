        "plot outline": "The series features a different musician/songwriting pair in each episode traveling to a different location in America. In small-town diners and churches, on front porch swings and at backyard BBQs, the team meets with an \"ordinary\" person who has demonstrated a great feat of courage, charity and/or character, to hear their inspirational story. They'll visit places from the storyteller's past, meet their families, and witness their struggles to overcome adversity. Then, from these up-close-and-personal experiences, the musician and songwriter craft a new, original song inspired by the deserving storyteller's personal narrative, to be revealed, as a surprise, before a live audience of our storyteller's friends and family at the end of the episode. Just like the best, most lasting music, the series celebrates honesty, sincerity, and real life. It introduces viewers to hardworking, sometimes struggling, people from across the country, and offers a look at how some of music's biggest stars touch lives through their music, shows, and philanthropy. Along the way, we'll find inspiration in the everyday people and communities that make our country great, and witness firsthand the power of storytelling through song.",
