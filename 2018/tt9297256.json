Set in the fictional City of Chesterdale, HIGH OFFICE is the epitome of political incorrectness and chronicles the day-to-day adventures (or misadventures) of Mayor Albert Dorsey and his unwitting staff. Alert is the personification of a bad politician and it can be said he knows nothing, if anything, about politics or appropriateness. But, somehow, he always finds a way to resolve the issue at hand to the satisfaction of his staff and to the people of Chesterdale. Albert is a feckless government leader who often underestimates the gravity of the situations he finds himself in which usually leads to him making matters worse by saying and doing the wrong things. If it wasn't for Albert's [somewhat] loyal staff, he would crash and burn. He relies on the advice and guidance of his city manager, police chief and the former deceased mayor, Harvey, who is an unhappy ghost that only Albert can see, for some reason. Each series, the team is presented with an ordeal with significant social and political ramifications if not resolved correctly.",
