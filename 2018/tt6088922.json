When she learns that she has unexpectedly beaten the cancer, she finds herself with no qualifications and no job. If this weren't bad enough, she then starts to learn that not only have her family been benefiting from her cancer in their own ways, but they have hidden many things from her in the hopes of giving her a happy life - her mother is in a lesbian relationship with a neighbor, her sister gave up a promising education, her brother has been sleeping around with married women and her family is nearly broke from her treatments. Worse still, her husband has lied about who he really is, keeping up a persona up around her. Stella must now re-discover her whole family and who they really are while trying to find out how you are supposed to carry on when, after years of facing your own mortality, she is given a life sentence."
