Based in Mussoorie, the suspense thriller cum serial killer story takes us through the trails n tribulations the daughter (female lead) endures. To add, her husband is also a police officer who is assigned this case but later withdrawn from the same as he is unable to catch Aks. Storyline: good Acting: average, unimpressive by both the leads. Better actors could have held audience' the interest. Direction: not at par. Loosely built characters, misses minutes details. Pro: good storyline and cinematography. Don't watch with high hopes and expectations."
