Through this thin line move the SEA ANGELS, equipped men and women both of the Italian Coast Guard and of several NGO trained to take action in extreme situations, when the smallest distraction can be fatal. The spectacular nature of their task goes along with their human side. Saving the lives of the thousands of castaways who arrive on the Sicilian shores in search of a better future, not only requires a good technique: it's a matter of heart and courage. Behind the action element there is always the human factor. The SEA ANGELS are not heroes from comics, they are real people, generous women and men who have decided to put their lives at stake to save other people. Men and women with their families at home waiting for them to return safe. Men and women trained to put their fears aside, weaknesses and personal political ideas, to rescue someone they've never met.",
