She then gets assaulted, but totally blacks out and can't remember anything about the attack. Haunted by this incident, she goes on a mission to solve the mystery. The situation quickly degenerates when she re-joins the online community and becomes the target of a smear campaign that poisons her life and puts her - and her loved ones - in danger. Throughout this nightmare, Marianne must find the strength and courage to still finish her video-game project on time in order to secure her professional future.
