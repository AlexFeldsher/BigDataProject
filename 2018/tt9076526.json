Over 20 years twin Brothers Daniel and Matthew Tobin created a studio and workshop that would enable projects for artists and designers to realise their creative vision. From humble beginnings in a small urban workshop casting bronze door handles to a worldwide enterprise across three continents working with over 130 staff to make some of the largest art in the world. Over this three part series we follow the UAP team across challenging large scale art pieces - working with fabrication teams, locations and materials, all while balancing client expectations, the budget and the artistic vision of each individual work. Using dramatic observational footage, reflective interviews, artist insight and extensive archive, we follow the conception, design, creation, installation, and stunning reveal of some amazing and inspiring large scale art.",
