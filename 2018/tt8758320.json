        "synopsis": [
            "Hankaar is a high-octane drama that takes the audience on an intriguing journey through the seedy underbelly of Mumbai. Ruled by the dreaded underworld don, Z (Ujjwal Chopra), Mumbai is just a chessboard for him with its residents, merely pawns. With the reins of the city in his hands, Z ensures that every major criminal business in the city belongs to him and every individual is under his thumb.The show introduces us to five individuals, seemingly unrelated to each other, from different strata of society, each trying to realize the big city dream and make their life better. They know their journey is going to be difficult and are aware that their aspirations might require them to navigate the crooked path of crime. Yet, they remain unaware that they are merely puppets being controlled by the mysterious Z.The story arc follows Nisha (Yogini Chouk Borhade) - the daughter of a prostitute persuaded to rescue victims of child and sex trafficking, Pradeep (Rajesh Balwani) - a real estate agent whose simple desire to move up the ladder turns his world upside down, James (Sharda Nand Singh) - a drug addict who wants a share of the trade, Mangesh (Prammod Sanghi) - a speech-impaired man from a chawl who won't stop at anything to rise above poverty and Joy (Ram Menon) - an unassuming 30-something tech-wiz at the threshold of entering the world of cyber-crime. Neither of them know the other and yet, have their destinies interlinked.Hankaar takes a sweeping look at the sordid activities that happen in every metropolis and in the process, it brings to life a sprawling tale that features multiple characters with each of them unknowingly playing a crucial part in a story written by someone else. Shot on actual locations in Mumbai and Germany, the show gives a new dimension to Mumbai and presents the city in a manner not seen before."
