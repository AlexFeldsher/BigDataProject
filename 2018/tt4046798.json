Lastly, unexpected developments and the almost destitute, we have the Chindlers. Four families. One gargantuan mess.\nThe intensity so overpowering you wont be able to hold back from connecting even at it's most basic level, Relative Opposites sheds light on the secretive and dark lonely places that many people like to keep hidden by showing how anyone can become something different, if only one would allow it."
