He promptly transmits information to Moscow. Agent Jafar works only with those who recruited him, and therefore the information comes to Andrei Rodionov, who knows Jafar since his service in Libya. With great reluctance, General Nefedov sends Rodionov on a dangerous business trip. And for Andrei, this is a chance to return to his previous work.",
