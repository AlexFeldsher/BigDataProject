The episode Matrimony is based on the victim of a scorned woman's revenge. This was written In thought of woman whose relationships suffer because of an ex. There was once a time when I felt she killed my marriage without a gun. The shooter was thought up to emphasize the catastrophic ending of something so beautiful. The shooter does not plan on letting him move on without her, especially in Holy Matrimony. If it's not her, it will be no one.    "
