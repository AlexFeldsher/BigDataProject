There is, of course a new and considerably younger and certainly far more attractive man in Sarika's life named Ranjeet, who happens to be a fan of Kunaal. The interpersonal relations of these four characters hold the story together as the eight episodes of the first season of Side Hero see Kunaal trying, failing, trying harder, failing harder but not ever stopping in his bid to make it big in Bollywood, even if only as the greatest Side Hero ever.",
