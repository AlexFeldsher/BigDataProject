She is still reeling from a shocking incident seven years ago, when the man she loved abandoned her. One day, Tan Dou Dou receives a package. It contains drugs and belongs to that same traitor boyfriend. Now caught in the middle of a drug deal gone hideously wrong, Tan Dou Dou decides to confront her ex. But she doesn't know the whole story. Jin Yuan (Luo Jin, The Princess Weiyoung) is an undercover cop. He has created a fake identity to work within the drug syndicate plaguing his city. He lies to protect those he loves. Even when he abandoned her, Jin Yuan was only working to protect Tan Dou Dou.

As he fights the crime ring he has infiltrated and dodges the law that considers him a criminal, Jin Yuan now also has to deal with his ex. She doesn't know who he really is and is convinced she can get him back on the \"right\" path. He has to keep lying to save the woman he loves but, sometimes, even love's lies are not strong enough to conceal its truth. Love's Lies is directed by Xu Jing. It aired in 2018.",
