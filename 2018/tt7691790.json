However, she was gifted in singing. With her lively nature and the support of senior stars and school mates from the same batch, Fubuki went on to become a top star in male roles. After she left the troupe, she was active as a singer and actress. She worked together with lyricist Iwatani Tokiko and from the many chansons she covered such as Edith Piaf's Hymne à l'amour, she was called the queen of chansons in Japan. She became an extraordinary singer who changed the history of the country's music scene.",
