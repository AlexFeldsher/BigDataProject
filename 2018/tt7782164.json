A dangerous new designer drug has hit the street and, having spent three years infiltrating the hierarchy of the Amsterdam drug mafia, Katja could finally be in the position to bring it down. But she's dangerously close and emotionally involved and, to make matters worse, suspected of having killed a Dutch police officer - to prove her loyalty to the cartel.
