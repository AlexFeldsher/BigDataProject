The series begins in the 80s in Galicia where, after the dictatorship of Franco and the fishing crisis, many Galician fishermen are full of debt and without a job. The economic scarcity of the fishing villages leads to the desperation of the inhabitants. Faced with this precarious situation, those who trafficked in tobacco will take advantage of the situation to try to expand their business to a more dangerous one: drugs. In this way, it will move on to the drug trafficking business on the Galician coast, where those in charge of trafficking in the area will contact the leaders of the Colombian cartels to traffic in a more significant substance with greater expansion during the decade 80: cocaine. With the expansion of the business, 80% of the European drug will land on Galician beaches.",
