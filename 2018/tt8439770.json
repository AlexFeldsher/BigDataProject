Li Chin-Ai (Rainie Yang) is a magazine photographer who is happy with her career and her relationship with her boyfriend, Chou Li-Yang (Sze-Ming Lu). She has tried hard to forget her first love, Tai Hai-An (Blue Cheng-Lung Lan), after they broke up 10 years ago. When Hai-An reappears in Chin-Ai's life unexpectedly, some things are just not right with him. First of all, he is still his 18-year-old self from their youth, and he is \"half-transparent\". Chin-Ai begins to wonder why she is the only person who can \"see\" Hai-An and if he's actually dead and appearing before her as a ghost. Whatever may be going on, it's obvious that Hai-An has no intention of leaving her alone and negotiates with Chin-Ai to live with her. Could this be Hai-An's way of reconciling his past with Chin-Ai or could this strange situation make Chin-Ai question the certainty of her future?",

            "Just when everything is going well for a 31-year-old woman, a very unusual kink complicates her life. Li Chin-Ai ('Rainie Yang' (qv)) is a magazine photographer who is happy with her career and her relationship with her boyfriend, Chou Li-Yang ('Sze-Ming Lu' (qv)). She has tried hard to forget her first love, Tai Hai-An ('Blue Cheng-Lung Lan' (qv)), after they broke up 10 years ago. When Hai-An reappears in Chin-Ai's life unexpectedly, some things are just not right with him. First of all, he is still his 18-year-old self from their youth, and he is \"half-transparent\". Chin-Ai begins to wonder why she is the only person who can \"see\" Hai-An and if he's actually dead and appearing before her as a ghost. Whatever may be going on, it's obvious that Hai-An has no intention of leaving her alone and negotiates with Chin-Ai to live with her. Could this be Hai-An's way of reconciling his past with Chin-Ai or could this strange situation make Chin-Ai question the certainty of her future?"
