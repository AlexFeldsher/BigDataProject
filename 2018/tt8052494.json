Naturally they strike up a conversation because neither of them has the ability to be quiet, and it was only a hop and a skip before \"The DJ Experiment\" was created. Season One is a FREE comedy sketch Web Series created by an all-FEMALE team of Writers and Composers. Each writer and composer has a unique voice that is exclusive to them and this is also part of the charm that will be \"The DJ Experiment\". This also means that this production also opens itself up to a wider community with the promise of a connection to at least one of the season's episodes. The switch of power with male actors playing the voice of female exclusive ideas is not lost, as the production recognises that this while not new is still not an evenly balanced concept in the industry. Oh, and there's a big musical finale in the final episode.",
