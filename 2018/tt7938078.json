The Macropods are a kangaroo family, forced to flee their native Australia for Sweden, looking for happiness and a safer life. Kangaroo siblings Benjamin and Molly begin their new school with mixed results. The older brother Benjamin wants to adapt and he tries his hardest to become accepted by the coolest gang of the school. Meanwhile, Benjamin's younger sister Molly wants to win the school's annual talent show with her new best friend Victoria. However, kangaroos are a rare sight in Sweden. Most people might have seen a kangaroo on TV, but they haven't gone to the same school as one - \"Caught by the Tail\" is a story of an unusually ordinary family of kangaroos trying to lead an unusually ordinary life.",
