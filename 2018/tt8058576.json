Gustav Holst's much-loved The Planets (premiered in 1918) and Vaughan Williams's choral masterpiece Toward the Unknown Region contrast with a new work by Anna Meredith and 59 Productions. Five Telegrams draws on communications sent by young soldiers in 1918 and features specially produced digital projections, creating a unique spectacle. A performance of Flourish with Fireworks in memory of the late composer Oliver Knussen, opens the programme of this first night.    "
