The hour-long episode airs Sunday, August 12 at 9 p.m. ET on MSNBC. \"Breaking Hate\" follows Picciolini, a former skinhead who uses his own personal journey to help others escape the movement he once helped build. In the episode, Picciolini brings together a former white supremacist who participated in the Charlottesville riots with the mother of Heather Heyer, the counter-protestor killed by the car that drove into the Charlottesville crowd on August 12, 2017. Together, they begin a larger conversation on the issues dividing the country today and discuss how to start healing the wounds left behind by tragic events such as Charlottesville. \"Hate is on the rise in America, it's emboldened, normalized, and destroying lives,\" says Picciolini, \"I've dedicated my life to pulling people out of hate. I know how these people think and how to help because I used to be one of them.\" \"Breaking Hate\" is produced by Part2 Pictures. Executive producers include Amy Bucher and David Shadrack Smith.",
