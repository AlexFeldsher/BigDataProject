Soon enough, the victim's identity is revealed: she was the wife of a dentist, who confesses the murder to the police. The news spreads like fire and quickly finds its way into the party at the mayor's house, where the most affluent public figures of the region are in attendance. A huge commotion ensues. The chief of police is quick to declare the case has already been solved. The mayor sighs with relief. His political aspirations would have been shattered if the brutal murder ended up on the front page of the local newspapers. The local journalist, frustrated with the lack of police reports filed in the town, used to spending most of his time covering local social events for the gossip page of the paper and republishing news stories from regional news outlets and. To him, the murder is the chance of a lifetime. He is convinced the victim's elderly husband is way too delicate and feeble to have carried out such a brutal attack. As soon as the young reporter starts digging deeper into the facts, he dies in a rather suspicious fire. With the experience of finding the body still etched into their memory and intrigued by the recent tragedies, the two teenage boys decide to investigate on their own. After all, what harm could possibly come from a bit of adventure?",
