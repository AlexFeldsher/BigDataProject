        "plot outline": "Exactly how Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza was built has mystified archaeologists for centuries. Now an incredible new discovery, the oldest Egyptian text ever found, details the work of a man, Merer, who was tasked with helping ferry thousands of tons of stone to the construction site of the Great Pyramid. This remarkable document from a 4,500- year-old piece of papyrus, is finally helping unlock the deepest secrets of this super-sized monument. Follow archaeologists as they piece together the inner workings of the Great Pyramid of Giza using clues from Merer's text as well as pieces of wood from a giant ship that belonged to the pharaoh Khufu. Experts reveal how workers like Merer harnessed the flood waters of the Nile to fill an incredible network of man-made canals that brought their boats close to the pyramid's construction site. These new discoveries and experiments are unlocking more than just how the Egyptians built the Great Pyramid - they are exposing the truth about how the pyramid project helped to build Egypt itself, transforming the nation and its people forever.",
