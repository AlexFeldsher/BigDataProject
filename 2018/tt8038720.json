However, they come from very different backgrounds and their personal motivations and emotional lives outside the police force differ as a result: Pike is an aspirational family man, the son of a decorated police officer who's determined to follow in his father's footsteps, but not be in his shadow.

            "Growing up, Bishop and Pike had very different lives. Pike's dad was the first black police commissioner and the son grew up always trying to live up to expectations, while Bishop grew up looking for a father figure as he was passed around foster homes, moving from school to school. _Bulletproof_ (qv) will put their friendship to the test for the first time.::ahmetkozan"
