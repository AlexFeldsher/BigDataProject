            "We all have that one friend, right?That one person in our life (we're not having sex with) that we don't know what we'd do without. The one mom's is always checking on and sees as another kid. The one who's seen you ugly cry when rent and those two parking tickets are due and your latest direct deposit is half the amount. The one you don't ever see leaving your life, but her significant others always feel some type of way about you. The one you want to see as a brother, but sometimes when he's in the right light you always wonder...Platonic is the story of two best friends who overlook their chemistry for the sake of the friendship -- no matter what in the world their loins are telling them to do. Sometimes friends don't become Ross and Rachel. Sometimes friends don't become Max and Kyle. Sometimes friends -- just stay friends.Wood and Brea are 20-something best friends trying to figure out life, their friendship and how to pop bottles on a layaway income. These seven episodes are a quick glimpse into their day to day lives. Whether they're trying to figure out how to split a bill, how to replicate an iconic pop culture photo, how to act when someone's job is on the line, how to FaceTime their parents, how to navigate their traditions and new relationships or how to act at a house party -- these slice of life episodes into their lives help you see how these two lives their lives, platonically.So, sit back. Relax... And high key wish you had a Platonic friends like this you could kick it with too."
