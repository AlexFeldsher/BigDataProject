The wacky interplay between an ambitious studio manager (Lynn), a laid-back engineer (Dave), a flighty marketing director (Katie), an obsessive-compulsive session player (Richard), and a gloomy, neo-goth receptionist (Caligo) as they work together on doing whatever it takes to land clients, build the business, and insure their reputations as recording industry heavyweights - each in their own weird ways, of course. A steady stream of interns that never quite work out are there to lend a hand. Can these peculiar personalities pull themselves together to make a go of it?",
