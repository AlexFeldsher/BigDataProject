She and her peers feel that society is something that they aren't on par with. In the midst of her life's journey, jellyfish is something that she begins to adore very much, due to some great childhood memories at an aquarium with her mother. When she first saw one, she dreamt that one day she wants to wear a dress just like these species. So, her mother promises her that she will make a wedding dress just for her which looks like a jellyfish. But, her mother suddenly passes away, which allures her into a world of adoration for these species. Eventually, she begins to disregard everything that goes around her, and dedicates her whole life to it. However, her life turns around all of a sudden, as she gets caught up in a triangular love relationship. Eventually, she realizes that she still has a chance of falling in love with someone for the first time, as she gradually discovers new ways of doing things.",
