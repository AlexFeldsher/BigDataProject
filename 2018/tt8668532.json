His new position disappoints the diverse writing mentees, who expected anyone but an old white racist guy. Unfortunately, they're in for an even bigger shock when the final mentee arrives - a seemingly straight, seemingly white, seemingly male writer. But the original seven mentees scheme to figure out how this white guy got in, and at least it takes their minds off of the disaster program they find themselves trapped in.",
