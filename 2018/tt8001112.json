            "Under the constant watch of the eye of God, known as Chronos, the heavens observe without interfering.Mankind, intoxicated by its arrogance and sense of entitlement, has insisted God abandon any intervention so man can evolve on its own. Humanity, now left to its own devices, has fallen prey to the very supernatural powers once oppressed by divine authority. In order to maintain the fragile balance between reason and madness, certain agencies were created to protect the mortal realm, referred to as Top Side, from the immortal threats called the Nocturne. Established first by the easily corruptible Templers, a clandestine group, known only as Majestic, and its enforcement unit, The Bureau, now run these institutions. These two powers dedicate themselves to the governing of the Nocturne, creatures that include such horrifying entities as Vampires, Luna, Sorcerers, Telepaths, Seers, and evils indescribable by the tongues of gods and man. However, as the newest century has barely matured, a bold and growing threat emerges. A long-forgotten enemy has returned, hell-bent on fulfilling a treacherous prophecy that threatens all of existence, both dark and light.Will a cynical witch, with a forgotten past, a troubled psychic, and a vengeful bloodsucker be able to stop this rising dark tide? Or, will our world, and any to come, face a judgment and damnation from a wickedness that redefines all we think we know about fear?At the edge of night, Dusk's legacy beckons, and darkness will fall."
