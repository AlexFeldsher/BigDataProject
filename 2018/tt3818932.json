He finds solace on Seth's couch, a childhood friend who has recently split with long time girlfriend Jill. Jason's best friend Doug decides to shoot a documentary about him. Jason agrees. However, things take a wrong turn when the camera captures truths that Jason would prefer to keep hidden; from driving Abigail into despair to betraying Seth (by sleeping with Jill) and failing to provide support to his close friend Blake as he slides into a world of addiction. Jason meanders through life, unable to acknowledge his personal lack of principles due to his own arrogance and hypocrisy. Suddenly the documentary becomes more exciting than Doug ever anticipated and he is forced to choose between friendship and success in the film world. Doug's true test of loyalty comes when his camera discovers Jason's sister Chelsea has become an amateur porn star. When everything gets out in the open and the final confrontations take place, the once happy gang appears to be scattered and damaged beyond repair. However, a truly shocking event to all will unite them in the process of mourning and lead them to re-evaluate their lives and the decisions that led them adrift. Maybe there is still a chance for them and their friendship to survive in a culture where going for a latte or a highball is the preferred elixir to feelings of regret, loneliness and despair.",
