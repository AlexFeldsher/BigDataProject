            "Ronny's whole life is based on a lie. To the world he is the nephew of the local MLA and a youth leader who solves people's problems. But in reality, Ronny is a jobless 25 year old with no relation to the MLA who shares his surname. The show explores Ronny's adventures as he gets stuck in multiple situations because of this lie. He has two trusted friends, Anwar and Kranti who don't know the truth either and consider Ronny their leader. Ronny is in love with Avantika but she is too busy obsessing about her ex to notice his feelings. His family is concerned about his future and is dismayed at his lack of interest in studying or getting a job. His sister who suspects Ronny is lying about something is constantly trying to get him into trouble with their parents. Ronny's trusted mentor Santosh Bhaiya is the only one who knows the truth and tries to help Ronny.::Ayush",
