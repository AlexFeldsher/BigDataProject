Living in London and working for barrister Michael Ennis, Kate's mother takes on a case involving an African militia leader which will upend both their lives forever.::Tom Daly",
            "Kate Ashby was rescued from the horrific aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. She was adopted and brought up in Britain by Eve Ashby, a world-class international human rights lawyer. Kate, who has long struggled to escape the shadow of her past, is now returning to work as a legal investigator in the same chambers as Eve, under leading international lawyer Michael Ennis. But Kate and Eve's relationship is strained to breaking point when Eve takes on the prosecution of a controversial militia leader at the International Criminal Court. The accused man, who once fought to stop the genocide in the Democratic Republic of Congo, now stands accused of committing crimes against humanity."
