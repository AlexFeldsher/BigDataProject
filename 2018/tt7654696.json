        "synopsis": [
            "Fuzzy Mac isn't your typical 13-year-old. For starters, her mum died when she was a baby and her dad went away to work in the mines; leaving her to live with her eccentric, spooky-loving Grandparents. Then there's the fact that she's the only teenager in town who isn't allowed a mobile phone. Fuzzy is worried about starting high school; but the ancestors have plans for her and things are about to get a lot more complicated!Growing up with an old world mix of Aboriginal Australian, Irish and South Sea Islander traditions;\nFuzzy's family are the traditional owners of the land and she has the extra responsibility of making sure Country is respected, as her ancestors have done for tens of thousands of years. Nan is teaching her about tradition and the spirits, but sometimes Fuzzy would rather be hanging out with her friends, like any teenager.So imagine Fuzzy's horror when she wakes up on her 13th birthday to discover she can see spirits! And worse still, they seem to think she's going to help them!Luckily, her best friends, Tui and Yar, always have her back. Tui is smart - she loves words and can help Pop with any crossword. She is the owner of a brand new mobile phone and lately she's been getting a lot of messages from Jesse, a skater boy from school. Yar is colourful, unconventional and loud. At the moment he's really into knitting his own beanies with the same flair as the rest of his clothes.School wouldn't be complete without the popular Cat and Emmy. Cat is the daughter of the Mayor and likes to boast about it too. Emmy will do anything to help her friend. Sure, they get on her nerves at times but Fuzzy has other things to worry about!There's a host of ghostly characters wanting her attention, like Fuzzy's ancestor Lola- the custodian of the land now named Lola's Forest; a strange boy-spirit named Bruce who's attached to Yar; an old mate and his spirit dog... and other more ancient spirit beings....Over the course of thirteen episodes, Fuzzy and her friends embark on a series of adventures with an eccentric assortment of characters - both living and dead - as Fuzzy learns how to help spirits with unfinished business, look after her cultural responsibilities... and be a modern teenager.It's not easy, but with her family, friends, the odd ancestor, and grace by her side, Fuzzy learns to accept her gift and thinks she can overcome anything! But can she...?"
