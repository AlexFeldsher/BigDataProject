            "An internet show based in Ohio that discusses radio-controlled (RC) aircraft, including fixed-wing (ie, planes), helicopters and multi-rotors. Webisodes often include builds, both from scratch and from kits, product reviews, and some mild buffoonery. Though presented in a light-hearted manner, the hosts share a considerable amount of knowledge with viewers regarding model building and design methods, first-person-view (FPV) flying, as well as new product information and technological advances in the hobby.In addition to in-house productions, the hosts travel to trade shows and RC events introducing the audience to other enthusiasts of the hobby. Though solely an internet entity (thus far), relatively high production standards are clearly evident in the completed webisodes. The producers, cast and crew make every effort to present sometimes dry information in an entertaining manner, while keeping commentary family-friendly.Episodes can be found on their YouTube channel, \"Flite Test.\""
