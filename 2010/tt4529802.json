Is man at the beginning of his journey or fast approaching the end? Might that end come about within the next century? Being the unquestionable masters of Earth, we humans have a way of taking our own existence for granted. But being a comparatively young species, maybe we shouldn't be so sure about our own survival, especially considering that 99.9 percent of all species that ever walked the earth have gone extinct. In the form of a Top-10 list of doomsday scenarios, Last Days of Man is a scientific examination of the disasters that have the capacity to annihilate the human race-and it's not just the usual threats from nuclear weapons, climate change, and meteorite impacts. There are a number of lesser-known but much more probable risks to humanity. The first episode investigates the dangers of nature's violent forces, while the second episode explores the threats that humanity has created for itself. Some scientists believe that humans have made themselves immune to extinction by colonization and by virtue of the sheer numbers of our population, while others believe the species is in grave danger and the coming century will be crucial for our survival. Through the testimony of renowned scientists from around the globe, we gain an understanding of these threats, how likely they are to come about, and what the consequences to human life would be.",
