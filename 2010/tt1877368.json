        "synopsis": [
            "Cooking competition show in which contestants are challenged to bake different types of foods, including cakes, biscuits and pastries, which are then judged by famous food writer Mary Berry and TV chef Paul Hollywood. Over the course of the series, contestants, all of whom are amateur bakers, must bake a wide variety of common dishes, set out by Mary and Paul. Each episode fits with a certain theme, with the common ones being cakes, biscuits, bread, deserts, pastries and tarts. Within each episodes, 3 'challenges' are completed, all of which are timed. These challenges are: 'Signature Challenge', where contestants bake using their own recipes, 'Technical Challenge', where contestants must follow a recipe and ingredients set out by Mary and Paul, and finally the 'Showstopper Challenge', where contestants go all out to bake an extravagant and creative piece. Often, these include entire scenes made out of food. At the end of each show, one contestant is named 'Star Baker' - based on their performance during the episode - and one contestant is sent home. At the end of each series, a number of episodes are dedicated to quarter finals, semi finals and grand finales. In these episodes, the food contestants bake is often very specific, such as gluten free food or French pastry. Alongside this, presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc talk with the contestants, as well as hosting a short film in the middle of each episode based on the episodes theme."
