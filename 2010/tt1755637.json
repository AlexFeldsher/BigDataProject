But things are far from being perfect: Minodora and Stiven are getting envious with the attention received by the newly-found brother, so Stiven comes up with a plan to get rid of Gabriel and get State's money. But he isn't the only one after State's heritage. Fabrizio, an old Mafia guy, returns to Romania with a view to making enough money to buy his place back into the Italian Family \"La Mafia\" after being banished from it. He tries to take over State's business in Romania and abroad, a situation that will give rise to a war between the families. In an attempt to help his father win the war, Gabriel offers to harm Fabrizio by seducing the two most important women in Fabrizio's life, his wife Romina and niece Carla. But his plans fail when Gabriel meets Carla with whom he falls in love unexpectedly. Caught up in a dangerous life-and-death game, Gabriel and Carla will have to stand up to what they are feeling, to their love and in the time escape the growing rivalry between the two families torn by secrets, intrigues and violence.",
