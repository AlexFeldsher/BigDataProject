The fear of falling behind British power as well as concern over defending wealthy lands in the Americas meant drastic reform under Bourbon king Charles III and his successors on the throne. In New Spain, the so-called Bourbon Reforms were designed to economically squeeze the colonies and keep a closer watch over their subjects. In a few years, however, the discontent caused by such measures would put the authority of the king himself over his extensive overseas realms at risk.",
