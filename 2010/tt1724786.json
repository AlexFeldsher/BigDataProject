Fighting their shared demon, alcoholism, the singing duo endure radical medical treatments, physical training, as well as medical and spiritual therapy to help them stay sober. Each day they learn to come to terms with the ever-present temptations that go hand-in-hand with their fame and fortune. By any means necessary, K-Ci & JoJo are determined to reclaim their honor and respect in the music game. The only thing more important than regaining their celebrity status is the preservation of their own lives. From their outpatient rehab, to emotional therapy sessions, to the North Carolina roots where their musical lives began, every aspect of their lives is examined and explored. K-Ci & JoJo must also face the realities of a post-recession, digital music industry while trying to fight against a fate worse than death... becoming musical \"has-beens\". Raw and real, Come Clean is an emotional roller coaster that affirms the amazing power of the human mind, faith, and love. Watch the fascinating, triumphant return of the group that is credited with saving the R&B music genre.",
