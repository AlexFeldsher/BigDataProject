When this art was created, Europe had already been peopled for hundreds of thousands of years by Neanderthals. Alda discovers, from visits to sites where Neanderthals once lived, that they were tenacious and resourceful, but they produced no art and employed a stone tool technology that changed little over millennia.

By watching - and participating in - experiments comparing chimps with children, he learns that human uniqueness lies in our ability to reason about things we can't observe, especially the content of others' minds, and to employ this skill in the collaborative enterprise we call civilization.
