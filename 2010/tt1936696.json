This particular piece really shows off Tommy's style in using rough cut lumber and gives Tommy a chance to put a contemporary spin on a traditional piece. In this episode, Tommy explains techniques for mortise and tenon joinery, as well as how to taper a leg. He also heads to the North Bennet Street School in Boston, where he meets up with Steve Brown, the head of the school's Cabinet and Furniture-making department. Later, Steve lends a hand back in Tommy's shop.    "
