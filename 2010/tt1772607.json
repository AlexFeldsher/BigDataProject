Externally the android is a copy of a girl - Nina - whose images where randomly selected from the internet by a lab technician. Nana wants to be human-like in every way, with emotions and feelings and see the world through human eyes. She purges herself of the mind-reading function as it is not a human one and escapes the lab where she was created. A chance brings the two girls together; Nana makes new friends, but the search to return the android back to his owner is on.",

            "A nanotech android - called Nana - was created on the orders of a terminally ill Russian oligarch who intends to use her as a business spying tool using her ability of mind-reading and ultimately as a body-host for his own dying body. Externally the android is a copy of a girl - Nina - whose images where randomly selected from the internet by a lab technician. Nana wants to be human-like in every way, with emotions and feelings and see the world through human eyes. She purges herself of the mind-reading function as it is not a human one and escapes the lab where she was created. A chance brings the two girls together; Nana makes new friends, but the search to return the android back to his owner is on.::vvp_14"
