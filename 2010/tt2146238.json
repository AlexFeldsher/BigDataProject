            "\"Calliope\" is a children's show in the traditions of the favorite shows of the past. Calliope (Rachel Elliott) is a clown who is working to perfect her craft, so she can join the traveling circus of her father, the Ringmaster. While she's learning, she lives in a circus caravan wagon in Calico Valley, accompanied by more than 30 puppet characters who assist in the lessons being presented. Featured puppets are Calliope's best friend, Penelope the dog ... Mr. MacAw, the parrot who delivers the mail ... Happy Monkey, who runs the grocery store ... and the caravan wagon's cook, Giuseppe the bear. Each program features a \"thought of the day,\" delivered by Calliope's pet chicken Bock-Bock. Every week, Calliope and her friends share positive life lessons with the children who watch."
