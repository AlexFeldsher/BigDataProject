            "The Stupid Christmas Show takes a off kilter humor look at the most magical time of year. From the folks at We'll Fix it in Post Productions who just want to wish you a wonderful holiday season. Written by Hollie Olson who not only is a published author of the humorous book, I'm Not a Groupie, I'm in the Band! The Real Life Adventures of a Female Musician, she has also wrote and directed several short films and the feature film, Gabby's Wish, a comedy-drama family movie. With The Stupid Christmas Show, Hollie looks closely around her own life to come up with episodes that feature a twist or gag ending."
