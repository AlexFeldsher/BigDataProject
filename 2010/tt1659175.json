            "TRANSFORMERS PRIME chronicles the triumphant return of the AUTOBOTS via the most cutting-edge computer-generated animation ever seen on television. From Executive Producers Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci ('Star Trek,' 'Transformers'\nfeature films, 'Fringe'), and Jeff Kline (\"Jackie Chan Adventures,\" \"Men in Black: The Series\"), Transformers: Prime deepens the epic mythology of both the AUTOBOTS and DECEPTICONS, while starting fresh for a new generation of viewers and future fans. OPTIMUS PRIME, BUMBLEBEE, ARCEE, RATCHET, BULKHEAD, and many others are back to \"roll out\" against MEGATRON's latest attempt to conquer Earth. And MEGATRON proves to be more powerful than ever, having acquired a rare element that allows him mastery over life itself. 'Team Prime' may be few against the DECEPTICON hordes, but they find increased strength via bonds forged with three human teenagers. Make no mistake, TRANSFORMERS PRIME WILL deliver heavy metal action, and nail-biting suspense -- but it also promises to take the human drama to levels as yet unseen by the franchise.\n"
