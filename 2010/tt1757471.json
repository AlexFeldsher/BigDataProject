            "Four rich people take up the challenge of living as a homeless for one full week. Followed from a distance by the camera crew, the candidates experience what it is like to have no money, no status and no roof above their heads. In order to make it as realistic as possible, the candidates must* have no money of themselves;* not use credit cards or book a hotel* not call any of their friends or relatives.After a few days they receive a 'buddy' who teaches them a bit and gives them some tips.Each of the contestants experences the ordeal in a different way. Ex-model Kim Kötter seems to breeze through the experience, but Patrick Lusink gradually loses the struggle with homelessness and quits after three days. The other two fare somewhere inbetween.The show ends with each of the remaining contestants being reunited with their loved ones, and a short interview a month later."
