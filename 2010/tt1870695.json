Chef Blais meets and observes the chefs creating the ultimate American meals, shares a meal with their loyal patrons, and delves into what it is that makes their offerings so irresistible, while uncovering the science behind why these foods taste so good. After visiting, Chef Blais returns to his food laboratory to create a new version of the iconic dish. Explaining the scientific method to his madness along the way, Chef Blais attempts to scientifically engineer a new-and-improved version of the meal he tasted in the restaurant. Armed with his reengineered version, Chef Blais returns to the legendary eating establishment where he'll put his new creation to the test- having the restaurant's loyal patrons sample and rate his dish versus the eatery's classic favorite.",
