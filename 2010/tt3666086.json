His failures eventually ruined his marriage with Rina (Mylene Dizon). After a series of unfortunate events, he proves to be a bad luck magnet as he was restrained to get near his son Miko; this after he became violent in a bar owned by his wife and her ex-suitor Brian (Ryan Eigenmann). Macario, his closeted high-school best friend, enters the picture in literally gay fashion as Kylie (Keempee de Leon) to the rescue. He convinced Dindo to mask his identity as a pretty woman and audition to be the next drag queen in Rina's bar. In order to get closer to his wife and son, Dindo is left without a choice but to turn from a man to a woman to a drag queen. His female disguise becomes even more awkward when he is courted by Rina's widower brother Henry (Roderick Paulate). Will Dindo get around the persistent courting of Henry (who is actually his brother-in-law)? Could he pass for the next drag queen in town? How long can he hide his real identity?",
