The odd friendship will usher Kringkring into JM's mysterious past including his unfinished business with the woman he truly loves. JM's soft spot surfaces when he starts playing a reluctant daddy to Kringkring's son. The impossible and indifferent JM will eventually break free from his past hurts and will finally realize t he value of love and commitment.",
