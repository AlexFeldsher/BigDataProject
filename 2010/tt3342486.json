        "plot outline": "Welcome to 12 Zodiac Way! This is a story of the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac like you've never seen them before! Come journey with us to a charming little town called Fortune Valley, where the twelve animal-totems now associated with the Chinese lunar calendar spend their days frolicking merrily, often joining together to pursue a host of colorful projects and plans. This tale unfolds around the one spot in town where the action never stops-that's Zodiac Way. Our twelve animals each take on roles designed to help their community flourish, assuming such varied posts as town sheriff, blacksmith, doctor, innkeeper, and noodle-maker extraordinary. Being the lively and imaginative lot that they are, these neighbors tend to turn day-to-day activities into one-of-a-kind adventures. A number of them employ formidable kung fu skills to aid them in the daily round, but at times their antics can prove to be a real handful for the peace-loving townsfolk of Fortune Valley! The Valley is a magical place hidden away in a mountain range that has been undisturbed for centuries. Since coming to reside there, The Twelve have added immeasurable zest to daily life in that locale. The streets are now filled with laughter, and good-natured hijinks abound. These twelve friends have not only brought to the town a new kind of energy, but most importantly, they are teaching the denizens of Fortune Valley to be strong and to persevere, even in the face of hardship. No problem is too big or too small for the twelve key inhabitants of Zodiac Way, and they're always willing to go that extra mile to help someone in need. 12 Zodiac Way is a Fantawild original series scheduled for release in early 2010. Each self-contained story in the series is intended for viewers between the ages of eight to sixteen. This program emphasizes themes of community and cooperation in a small-town setting richly evocative of China's distant past.",
