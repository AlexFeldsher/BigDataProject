She lived a simple life with her father Ted in the province while Belinda experienced a luxurious lifestyle with Irene in the city. The differences between Bambi and Belinda ignited further tensions which are also triggered by the special attention given by Irene to Bambi to catch up and make up for the lost time they were not together. Belinda finds comfort in the arms of Jacob, known as one of the school's outcasts. Jacob offers reassuring words to Belinda which later on develops into a special friendship between the two. Aside from Bambi's newfound home, she also transfer to Belinda's campus where she meets a new batch of friends including luisa (Luise delos Reyes), Aya (Joyce Ching) and Jacob (Jake Varges). Adding spice to her school life are Leslie (Lexi Fernandez), Rick (Derrick Monasterio) and Josh (Joshua Dionisio). Josh is widely known as the Rebel in the campus. He spends more time alone and often rejects the rules imposed by his sister Rose (Roxanne Barcelo). Nothing can get in his way except Bambi who softens his heart and strong persona. Meanwhile, Rick, Belinda and Leslie organize an underground victory party in celebration of the championship won by the varsity team. Even the school's \"outcasts\" headed by Bambi, Jacob, Aya and Luisa arrive at the festivity. In the middle of the party, a commotion erupts which is masterminded by Josh. Everyone is reprimanded and the school authorities order them to attend a recollection as punishment. The students think it is the usual recollection but they get the shock of their lives when they discover that the affair will be in the form of various activities that will test their strengths, weaknesses, emotions and their way of thinking.",
