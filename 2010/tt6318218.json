        "plot outline": "This drama depicts the life of a special generation when Chinese society undergoes fundamental changes in last century. Liang Zhiyuan, a new graduate, encounters Xu Xiaoman on his first day at work, and then starts a touching love story of twists and turns with Xu Xiaoman. When Liang Zhiyuan starts at his work, he is regarded as a promising successor by his leader. At that time, he is an idealistic young man who freshly gets out of school. Even though he has an outstanding education background, he knows few about worldly relations. Unlike him, Xu Xiaoman, though beautiful and young, is more sophisticated and experienced when it comes to worldly wisdom. Because of this fundamental discrepancy, Liang Zhiyuan and Xu Xiaoman's relationship does not work out. They eventually break up and start families respectively. However, deep down inside, their feelings towards each other are more intertwined than ever. When they gradually become middle-aged, they both start to reflect on the meaning of life and their original values.",
