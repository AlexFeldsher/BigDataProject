        "plot outline": "Big predator expert and attack survivor Dave Salmoni brings new techniques and technologies to bear on the exploration of wild animal attacks on humans. Few people will ever experience anything more physically devastating, blindsiding and bizarre than those who have been attacked by a wild animal. An attack victim himself, Dave is uniquely suited to help victims recover from the emotional trauma, provide an understanding of how animals become provoked and explore ways to prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future. In each episode Dave meets with two attack victims and walks them through their ordeal, on numerous levels, in an effort to help them recover and learn to appreciate these untamed animals. In each story, Dave returns with the victim to the site of the attack, the victims help stage an impressionistic recreation of their ordeal and finally they are introduced to a tame animal of the same species. Dave helps us understand the animal's point-of-view as he explores the motivation for the attack. He shows the victim and the viewer, that the animals are most likely not stalking us, but either patrolling their territory, protecting their young, or even suffering the pangs of starvation. He looks at how we can share our wild spaces with these animals while avoiding a similar horrific fate.",
