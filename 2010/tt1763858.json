            "Police Women of Dallas follows several female officers as they patrol the more dangerous streets of Dallas. They sometimes work alone and have to deal with some pretty intense situations while the show also follows two loveable and funny partners. They may be cute, but these girls can all hold their own! If I had to create a tag line for the show, it would surely be:\"Cute, Cunning, & Courageous Cops\"The show also shows the personal side of these officers as they follow them on the streets and at home."
