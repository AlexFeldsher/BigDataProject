Its innovative style of discussion around a table in a peaceful, low lit, comfortable surrounding differs from the pulpit pastor preaching. The topics convey a much different, younger perspective into Christianity and evangelism. The youthful and upbeat personalities allow the hosts to talk to the viewers and not at them. The Revolution intends to fire up emotion in the hearts of its viewers with everyday modern family experiences and testimonies fueled by the Bible itself.
