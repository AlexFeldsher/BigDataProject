            "Watch this Animal Hoarding show because it actually helps the people and animals get help. This disorder is very complex. Its not just about getting a clean house, and making fun of the afflicted. It is written with the core issue at heart, why people do what they do, and what can be done to help. The episode with the man who is on a pacemaker yet neglects his health to keep a league of mastiffs after his wife dies. Any professionals will see parallels here.This is constructive reality, which isn't mean-spirited and tries to make the situation better. Not the usual exploitative reality trash, which as a writer I refuse to watch. Maybe producers eventually will see the light and make more shows on these lines. Kudos to Animal Planet."
