Over three and a half gruelling years, and guided by an old Kazakh wisdom - \"to understand the wolf, you must put on the skin of a wolf and look through its eyes\" - Tim lived just as the ancient nomads did. The extreme challenges gave Tim empathy and insight into the nomadic way of life, and as a young man growing up, the journey became a personal rite of passage.
