When Melty tells Maven about the mysterious Kelpman of Lickhou - which ruffles his victims' hair before sucking out their brains through their ears - Maven goes into a blind panic... while Sporall discovers the real reason the tessellator has been broken in the first place.

Life on the island is rather Orwellian: each colourful member of the community is monitored by a surveillance system of tessellators, from local folk dribbler Melody Lane to weather monk Tracee Henge. The tessellators include video cameras for surveillance, but also little screens to allow the residents to watch important island events, such as the tri-annual island cow wash (live from Glotters field). Additionally, they include a handy slot for paying fines, and a sphincter nozzle for product and pill downloads. Notably, each episode of This Is Jinsy features a notable guest star actor.
