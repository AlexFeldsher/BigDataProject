            "The Octopus Demon and the beautiful Patrushka host a different original short comedy-horror tale each month. The stories include bizarre plots, campy acting, and dead pan humor, as long as the actors can keep a straight face. It's the perfect weird late night program for the perfect weird late night audience. Plus, some old time TV legends find their way to be interviewed in occasional episodes.::John Greff"
