Each animal is shot on a white cyc and a similar graphics package insures continuity with the 101 brand. Each segment in the show will focus on the physical characteristics, origin and care needed for each pet. A team of experts provides the gravitas while the personal story of one pet owner provides the emotion in each segment.
