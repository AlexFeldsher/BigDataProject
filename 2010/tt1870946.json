            "Where can you go when you're in dire need of a used strait jacket? What if you just have to have a two-headed cat or a book bound with human flesh to make your living room complete? There's only one emporium sublimely weird enough to carry these bizarre items and countless more - Obscura Antiques and Oddities in New York's East Village. Science Channel's breakout series, ODDITIES, follows Obscura's proprietors, Mike and Evan, as well as an assortment of hilariously-unique patrons who are even more outlandish than the merchandise.Obscura is renowned for having some of the rarest and most-eccentric antique pieces found anywhere - from circus sideshow props, to shocking natural anomalies, to oddball items dabbling in the occult. Aficionados of the unusual from throughout the U.S. and beyond know that Obscura is the only place to purchase their next treasure - or sell their own abnormal assets. Mike, Evan and consultant Ryan serve as the ringmasters for this one-of-a-kind experience that's part swap meet and part cult rally."
