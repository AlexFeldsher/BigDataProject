            "Host & Producer Joseph Kay takes a look at some films of the past, breaking down what went wrong, but celebrating what went right. Most of the films featured on this internet-based review show are either lesser known sequels, or generally considered as having a \"B-movie\" quality. Staring in 2009, this online review show began with a review of \"Missing in Action III\", a Canon Films production. Since then, the show has reviewed several movies over two seasons. The shows exists to give fair, yet humorous analysis of these films, and also to serve as a history lesson by exploring how the films came to be. This series follows strongly in the tradition of \"Siskel & Ebert\", \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", and more recently the \"Nostalgia Critic\", as it utilizes fair use of a copyrighted work for both (1) criticism and comment, and (2) parody and satire."
