        "plot outline": "Old Friends is comedy about friendship, sex, boundaries and virginity. It is the story of Tim and Nick, two 28 year-olds who, until now, haven't seen each other since high school. Tim is married to his high school sweetheart, Andrea. Nick is dating Andrea's best friend, Katie. Everything would be fine if Nick hadn't taken Andrea's virginity back in high school. Since high school, Nick's life has been impulsive and non-committal. He's a bartender living in New York, enjoying the women and the lifestyle and taking it as it comes. Tim married Andrea, his high school sweetheart, shortly after graduating and they now live comfortably together in Manhattan. Having never explored a life of sexual promiscuity, Tim is implicitly skeptical of Nick and deeply resents him for having slept with his wife. Nick, who has never had a serious relationship, now sees a chance to re-form some old bonds with Tim and his still very sexy wife. Old Friends follows the unlikely series of events that draw Tim and Nick ever closer, even though Tim would like nothing more than to see Nick die in a fire.",
