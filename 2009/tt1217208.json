        "plot outline": "\"\"\"The Philanthropist\"\" chronicles the heroic adventures of a billionaire playboy-turned-vigilante/philanthropist. James Purefoy (\"\"Rome\"\") stars as Teddy Rist, a successful tycoon whose life is forever changed after rescuing a young boy during a hurricane in the Nigerian town he was visiting. Rist is spontaneous and impulsive and quickly decides to channel his passion, power and money into helping those in need. A man who has everything but feels nothing, Rist keeps his adrenaline pumping by putting his business acumen and money-making skills to good use by bargaining with the self-righteous as he makes deals with drug barons and trading with the nefarious. Jesse L. Martin (NBC's \"\"Law & Order\"\") plays Philip Maidstone, Teddy's business partner and friend, and Neve Campbell (\"\"Party of Five,\" \"Burn Up\"\") plays Olivia, Philip's wife who also runs the charitable foundation set up by the two billionaires.
