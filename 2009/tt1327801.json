            "A group of ambitious misfits try to escape the harsh realities of high school by joining a glee club.",
            "When a High School Spanish teacher, Will Schuester, becomes the director of the school's failing _Glee_ (qv) club, New Directions, he hopes to be able to rejuvenate it. The club competes in the choir competition circuit. It's been called \"a High School Musical for adults\", the series follows the club and its mixture of oddball members as they try and restore it to its former glory. It is a musical comedy in which the eager and ambitious students not only compete to win the Nationals, but also have to deal with the tough and cruel realities of their school, McKinley High. At the same time, Will is trying to rejuvenate his failing love life whilst preventing the school's cheer leading coach Sue Sylvester from sabotaging the choir.::WellardRockard",
            "When a high school Spanish teacher becomes the new glee club coach (a clubs he was previously in) he takes on a group of very different but talented students. Training a glee club has never been so amusing. New bonds created and friends for life made. Get ready for \"New Directions\"::Alicia Jayne",
            "McKinley High School, in Lima Ohio, is forever changed when Spanish teacher Will Schuester revives the school's show choir. As Will begins to recruit members for his dancing and singing glee club, he realizes that his ragtag group of high school outcasts could become a sensation. The students who take a chance on glee club soon become life-long friends as they battle school humiliation, heartbreak, loneliness, and bullying. When glee club proves to be very good and talented, the school's cheerleading coach (Sue Sylvester) takes it upon herself to destroy the club and everyone involved with it. As glee club is thrown numerous challenges by the high school popular kids, rivalling show choirs, and Sue, Will won't give up on the budding student stars. Will faces phenomenal stress levels as he deals with one of his students (Kurt Hummel) being mercilessly bullied, trying to meet the diva that is Rachel Berry's high demands, mentoring football jock Finn Hudson (who is confused by all the elements of his life), two of his students dealing with teen pregnancy, and desperately trying to fix his toxic marriage. Through all of this drama, glee club must win their competitions if they want to continue existing. The show also focuses on the McKinley alumni after graduation; following Kurt and Rachel navigating the scary streets of New York, the other graduates scrambling to make it big in California, and Will who tries to get a second generation of glee clubbers. _Glee_ (qv) explores the ups and downs of high school life and love while emphasizing the importance of equality in schools and the world and also sharing light on the countless problems that face students and school faculty today."
