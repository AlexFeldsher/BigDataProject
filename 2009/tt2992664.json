Half of the women chosen are aspiring fashion models, while the other half are aspiring adult actresses. Thus the house is broken into two competing groups, Team Models and Team Pornstars. Each morning the Sex Lives mailman delivers the day's erotic activity, which the teams compete in for a variety of rewards. Similar to The Real World, a confession booth is available for the roommates to vent and express their true feelings. Sex Lives premiered on December 16, 2009. The show features three porn stars as Team Pornstars and those three stars include Brooke Banner, Morgan Dayne, and Britney Blew.",
