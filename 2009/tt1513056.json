            "The driver of a power shovel suffers an accident at night in the vicinity of the works of a controversial power line that must cross a cliff. Considered since times of old a sacred place, the locals know of strange lights up there and unexplained phenomena. The unusual circumstances of the incident left the young man in a coma and force an investigation of the authorities. A detective from the capital is sent to the small town to help the inexperienced head of the local police in the investigation of the facts. As often happens in cases of small towns, petty interests, secretiveness, and small intrigues make things more complicated than it may seem at first glance. A group of dedicated ecologists are opposed to the cliff project, which is the first step to the building of a dam. As the investigators progress in their investigations, more accidents happen and the number of victims is increasing. The pressure from police chiefs to resolve the case mounts and the detectives themselves trapped by the magic of the mountain.::bobbuckingham"
