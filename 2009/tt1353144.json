        "plot outline": "At seventeen, filled with dreams and hopes, Maysa marries the love of her life, Andre Matarazzo, an industry titan with whom she has her only son, Jayme. The strictness of life in the family mansion, however, contrasts with the festive and artistic environment in which she grew up. Despite Andre's opposition, Maysa's superb voice lands her an invitation to record an album, and her music becomes an instant success. Maysa's new, demanding career results in the collapse of her marriage and takes a toll on her relationship with Jayme. In search of professional achievement, she risks everything and immerses her body and soul into singing. She earns standing ovations while crisscrossing the globe. Once divorced, she engages in turbulent relationships. She breaks taboos and defies conventions. And she dies tragically and prematurely. \"Maysa: when the heart sings\" tells the story of a woman ahead of her time, who gave herself to life and to love with the same intensity as she composed and performed.",

            "A woman who follows her heart in every single step of her life, breaking paradigms, following her dreams and becoming one of the greatest Brazilian singers.::m_diasr-leite",
            "At seventeen, filled with dreams and hopes, Maysa marries the love of her life, Andre Matarazzo, an industry titan with whom she has her only son, Jayme. The strictness of life in the family mansion, however, contrasts with the festive and artistic environment in which she grew up. Despite Andre's opposition, Maysa's superb voice lands her an invitation to record an album, and her music becomes an instant success. Maysa's new, demanding career results in the collapse of her marriage and takes a toll on her relationship with Jayme. In search of professional achievement, she risks everything and immerses her body and soul into singing. She earns standing ovations while crisscrossing the globe. Once divorced, she engages in turbulent relationships. She breaks taboos and defies conventions. And she dies tragically and prematurely. \"Maysa: when the heart sings\" tells the story of a woman ahead of her time, who gave herself to life and to love with the same intensity as she composed and performed."
