The selected Stunters are provided with Bajaj Pulsar 220 DTS-i bikes to do the different stunts in order to advance to the next round. In the first episode the contestants are divided into teams or squads (usually Red, Blue, Yellow and Green) and the team members decide their respective team names. They are also given gear and bikes of their respective team colour. Each episode features Skill challenges and Survival Stunts. In Skill Challenges the squads have to perform different tasks while doing a Skill Stunt which are decided before hand. The team that performs the best stays immune and goes to the next round. The other teams have to face the Survival Stunt . Each team has to nominate one person for the Survival stunt. The person with the relatively worst performance in the survival stunt has to leave the show. This continues until the number of stunters reduce to a small number. Before the finale there is usually a 'Wild Card' challenge in which all the eliminated contestants get an opportunity to get another shot at getting back into the competition by competing against the other eliminated contests in a daunting challenge. At the end, the winner of the grand finale stunt wins the reality show with a cash prize, a custom Bajaj Pulsar and of course the title of India's best Stunt-rider.",
