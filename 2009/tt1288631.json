Weakness, courage, greed, opportunism, love, anti-semitism, all interact in this account of how a community taken over by a brutal conquering power survives. While every viewer of the series knows the ultimate outcome, the inhabitants of the village do not. The series illuminates the agonizing choices people face when survival means treachery and resistance torture and death."
