            "The first Polish dance and music series, \"Tancerze\" follows the lives of students and teachers of a private performing arts school. The lead cast includes: Katarzyna Glinka, Katarzyna Cichopek, Marcin Dorocinski, Magdalena Walach and Natalia Lesz. The series is based on a Spanish format inspired by multiple-award-winning American series \"Fame\". The first episode of the third season is scheduled to air on September 16 at 9:40 p.m on TVP2.\"Tancere\" is set in a performing arts school run by Helena Nalecz-Gonzales (Malgorzata Niemirska), who, after years spent at a similar academy in Madrid, opened her own school in Wroclaw. The teaching staff includes Alicja (Magdalena Walach), Helena's former student whose life changed after a stage accident; Roma (Katarzyna Glinka), a would-be artist; Krzysztof (Marcin Dorocinski), an unpredictable actor and lothario; and a number of other eccentric characters. They all have one thing in common - their artistic careers have in various ways complicated their lives.\nTheir students include energetic Inga (Natalia Lesz), haughty Sylwia (Dorota Czaja), shy Dorota (Karolina Szymanska), arrogant Robert (Kamil Czarnecki) and flamboyant Kuba (Leszek Stanek). They all share an enthusiasm for what they do and determination to achieve success. They discover, however, how much they have to sacrifice to achieve their dreams. Balancing your career and personal life is a very hard task. \"How much more am I prepared to sacrifice for the sake of my career?\" They all have to answer this question.\n\"Tancerze\" is based on a UPA Spanish format inspired by well-known American series Fame (1982-1987), winner of 3 Golden Globe awards, including best series, and 11 television Emmy awards. The series is filmed in Wroclaw is a specially-built, giant-sized, two-story, more-than-2000-square-meter set that includes a dance room, theater room, teachers' rooms and students' dorm."
