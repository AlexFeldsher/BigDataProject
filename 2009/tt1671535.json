He finds a friend in fellow misfit Jack, the thing is nobody else can see Jack and Sam ends up on the receiving end of the school bullies' taunts. Jack takes Sam back-in-time and introduces him to his world but in his own world the bullies take things too far. Injured and laid up at home, Sam realizes he does have other friends at school. He finds a way of telling them about Jack, a ghost from the past, and together, they go to Jack's world.",
