            "Four recently paroled female English thieves pull an elaborate stunt to steal a fortune in cash and get a crime boss arrested for it. They plan to escape to Barbados with the loot, but mess up. They hide for a while in Scottish town _Hope Springs_ (qv), where they pretend to take over the run-down hotel as a cover. They soon lose the fortune in a fire, so they must stay and make the hotel work, but get caught up in local crime mysteries too.::KGF Vissers",
            "Ellie, Josie, Hannah and Shoo are four ex-cons who upon their release from prison find themselves with £3 million due to their latest scam. Planning on starting a new life, they initially plan to lie low and wait for trouble to die down, and subsequently end up in _Hope Springs_ (qv), an unremarkable Scottish village, and in the failing B&B of the kind-hearted Sadie Cairncross (Annette Crosbie). But for the girls, the trouble has only just begun."
