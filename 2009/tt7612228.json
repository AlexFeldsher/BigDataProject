Following the end of the rebellion, post revolutionary Mexico brought with it new trends for the State. Agricultural policies under Álvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías Calles would be of great relevance, as would the arrival of Mennonites. Thus Chihuahua started out on the path toward agricultural development, becoming a major crop producer. Thanks to its border location, it has consolidated its position as one of Mexicos most dynamic industrial centers, which includes backing technical and college education among state residents. Multicultural, competitive, and modern without forgetting its culture and roots, now, in the 21st century, the state of Chihuahua has blazed a trail into the world.",
