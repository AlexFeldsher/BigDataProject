            "From PBS - TIME TEAM AMERICA plunges the viewer into the grime and glory of real-life archaeology: epiphany and exhaustion, discovery, and disappointment. The team endures dirt, sweat, dust, and rain to explore the mysteries of the past through what they find buried below the ground. Part adventure, part hard science, part reality show, TIME TEAM AMERICA applies the latest technology and the team's collective expertise to solving the riddles of the past--against a ticking clock. The team has just three days to find out what it can at each site."
