Sang Eun intends to stay just a few weeks to placate her father in order to get his permission to marry Alex. However, the two families, based on a promise made in childhood, have always planned on their children marrying, and Sang Eun soon finds herself in over her head. Kim Yeo Joon, a prickly, stubborn doctor, is equally uninterested in her, but when the two find themselves in the same boat, they reluctantly join forces to outwit their families' plans."
