Maybe it's that great indie-flick that was released during the same week as Iron Man 2 or that brilliant foreign film that didn't get great US disbritubtion, or even that box-office smash...from 50 years ago. With more and more legitimate VOD and DVD rental options available, many films that might have gotten by us can now get new attention. Each week, these two regular guys produce fun and engaging movie criticism and hopefully gain these movies some new fans. Each 25 minute episodes chock full of commentary. They are spoiler-free, and delivered every Wednesday to an audience of millions worldwide."
