For one week South Africa's Kruger National Park offers an unadulterated perspective of the area's wildlife. On location at Nwanetsi Concession at Singita, one of Africa's preeminent safari game reserves housed inside Kruger National Park, Caught on Safari: Kruger beautifully captures the landscape, which is nestled among the Lebombo Mountains overlooking the African plain, and the Nwanetsi river. Through an insider's peek into life at the reserve, we hear directly from the game rangers and wildlife trackers watching over Singita, and learn about Africa's conservation issues. This concession in the Kruger National Park represents one of Africa's few territories where large prides of lions thrive, along with many other species including buffalo, leopard, white and black rhino, cheetah and elephant, among others. November in the park marks the beginning of summer, bringing with it the birth of many young animals around the park including impala lambs. Cameras are set up at watering holes around the park and other locations to non-invasively capture animals at home in their environment and filming takes place both during the morning and the afternoon. Wildlife correspondent Michaela Strachan, filmmaker John Varty and professional wildlife guide Andy Coetzee accompany us on this exciting adventure.",
