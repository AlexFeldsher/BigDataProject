            "We do not want to be sick. We do not want to be forgotten. That, however, is what the people in this film are. Seven percent of the population of the Republic of Estonia does not have health insurance. There is only one ward with 25 beds in the entire country for their treatment. And the women who care for the seriously ill.Day after day, they have to manage with difficulties, the existence of which nobody want to hear about and even less to see. Yet this film tries to do all this. To see and hear people's cries for help and the need for closeness."
