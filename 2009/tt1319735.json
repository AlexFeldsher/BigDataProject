            "ROYAL PAINS centers on a young E.R. doctor who, after being wrongly blamed for a patient's death, moves to the Hamptons and becomes the reluctant \"doctor for hire\" to the rich and famous. When the attractive administrator of the local hospital asks him to treat the town's less fortunate, he finds himself walking the line between doing well for himself and doing good for others.::Lynn Weiss",
            "Hank Lawson is a doctor who can diagnose a person on the spot and treat them with whatever is around. When he chooses not to personally care for one of the trustees of the hospital where he works (who dies), he is unfairly blamed, fired and blackballed. After months of self loathing, his brother Evan (who is not exactly serious and responsible) takes him to the Hamptons for a break. While there, Hank prevents its local doctor from making a mistake during a medical emergency. Wealthy resident Boris asks if Hank would consider being the town's g.p. or concierge doctor, and soon everyone in town begins calling Hank to treat them. He is also approached by a woman named Divya who wants to be his physician's assistant, but only after meeting Jill Casey, the administrator of the local hospital, does Hank decide to stay, moving with Evan into Boris' guest cottage.::rcs0411@yahoo.com"
