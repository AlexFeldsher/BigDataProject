            "Nick and Evan only wanted to do good: their brainchild was a reality show in which they help people overcome their worst fears by facing them, together: It's extreme home makeover, for the soul. But when three executives at Triple Threat Productions get their hands on the idea, they turn it into something far more sinister. Suddenly Nick and Evan find themselves executing 'dares' based on what the viewers--indeed what any rational person--would be too afraid to do. Two dueling camera crews (one of which is questionable both in professionalism and basic morality) complicate matters further, and Nick and Evan end up unwilling participants in a show that threatens to derail their lives, relationships and general faith in humanity."
