            "After the summer of 2006, full of party at the beach, Leks & Stefan (both finished their studies) decided not to find a 9-5 job or to start a family, with a station wagon, 2 kids, a dog, a nagging wife and a mortgage. They left the moment their friends had to start work or study again and followed their dream of an endless summer. With Leks' old surf van and the boards on top, they drove south, following the sun and the coastline, from Holland, through Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal and Morocco, to end up in a totally different world, the Sahara. These series of a trailer and 80 episodes tells the story of the 2 crazy Dutch boys and their adventures during their mission to find themselves and the meaning of life. Humour is the most important aspect of the material, followed by the beauty of the landscapes and people they meet. Together they laugh, fight, learn and see the world as it really is. They are changed forever, crazy, but wise, although not everybody will see that..."
