With over 24 years experience in the business, Cyrus is a genuine King of Queens. Cyrus has transformed even the ugliest of ducklings into award winning pageant stars. From Miss Teen to Miss World, Cyrus along with his Gowns and Crowns team has helped their clients win over 1,000 titles. The Journey to the pageant stage is far from easy.

Cyrus meticulously and methodically prepares each hopeful from head to toe by concentrating on both their inner and outer beauty, while providing them with the tools for life's lessons. No pasty gets misplaced, and no rhinestone goes unpolished under Cy's watch. And fortunately for Cyrus, he is supported by a team who loves him as much as he loves pageants. There's Shane, the interview coach, who puts up with Cy's mood swings and technology deficiencies. There's Kyle, Cy's self-appointed coordinator, who has a flare for fashion along with a true passion for the beauty business. And finally, there's pageant instructor, Amanda, Cy's true story of a girl who started as a pumpkin and turned into Cinderella.",
