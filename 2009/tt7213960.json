The private past of each of the protagonists has an affinity to our national history. Their personal stories provide us with a view into the national past and fascinating historic issues and events. One of the more prominent characteristics of the State of Israel is its ingathering of immigrants and thus provides fertile ground for the series. The roots of the family tree of each of the Israelis can be found in various countries around the world and are endowed with stirring tales of wandering, surmounting hardships, separations and encounters. Each of the six episodes is devoted to one public figure who embarks on a journey across borders to the unknown. The public figures include - Gabi Gazit - Radio show host, Yoram Yovel - Psychoanalyst, Tal Fridman - Comedian and Actor, Ohad Knoler - Actor,Shifra Horn - Novelist, Michal Yanai - Actress. The series is being produced according to the British Format \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" of \"Wall To Wall Television\" Company.",
