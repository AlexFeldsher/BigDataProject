            "Astounding progress has been made by the United States government in the development of the once-theoretical Mach 24 jet engine. Fast jets, however, need fast pilots and a program to re-engineer aviators with accelerated reflexes and neural pathways capable of flying these fighters has been a disaster. Four prime candidates were upgraded. All four died horrifically. A fifth, Quinn -- never meant as anything more than a disposable test subject -- has unexpectedly survived the strain to his nervous system. Hunted and confused, Quinn is now a violent fugitive on the run from his grave. Drugged, hunted, and slightly silly in a murderous way, he's on the move."
