        "plot outline": "Gert and Jes have been together for a very long time. One day Gert gets the job of his life: to work in a large branch in Shanghai. That job is his dream and he knows that Jes would go with him - Jes always follows him everywhere. Right? Not so. The day of departure, she decides not to go. The otherwise so compliant Jes decides for once in her life to make a decision for herself, hoping that Gert will change his mind for once. She dumps her boyfriend and follows her own path. But Gert departs for China. Jes leads a single life in Brussels, helped by her sister Michelle, her macho gay friend John, the cynical lawyer Luc and her new best friend, the chatty artist Sofia. Her choice has implications for everyone.",
