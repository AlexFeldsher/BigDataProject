The Choir Master Michael's crush on the choirs new soprano Layla, and his own musical ambition, drive him to blow up his marriage with Esther and consequently divides the choir in half. While Michael continues to master the original choir singing more traditional songs, Esther and her two sons set up a new choir called '_All the Small Things_ (qv)' with the help of the churches new curate Jake. Jake seems to take a strong liking to Esther and as the series continues we see this attraction blossom. The new choir, '_All the Small Things_ (qv)' take on a much more modern approach to music and sing songs by famous band Blink182, such as 'What's my age again?'. This is much to the horror of the original choir who sing more conventional songs. The series follows the lives of the people in both these choirs, as they compete with each other in professional competitions and as new relationships are formed between characters.::Noodles"
