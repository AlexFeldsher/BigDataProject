            "Each episode ventures into the lives of great junior surfers who may one day go on to be world champs. The new TV show is not just for the surfing obsessed. Each program follows the pro juniors from the House to the Ocean, meeting their families, friends and fellow surfers along the way, to find out what drives these young guys and girls to commit their lives to surfing. As part of the show, TV, Sport and Music celebs compete against each other in a heat dubbed 'Celebrity Drop-In' - Xavier Rudd, Erin McNaught, Trevor Hendy, Shannon Ponton, Renee Bargh and Lara Bingle make an appearance. The show culminates in the junior surfers vying for a chance at $20,000 in prize money. This show is a fantastic investment in surfing's future and hopefully will inspire a few future surf legends sitting on their couches at home to get into the water and give surfing their all.::next wave"
