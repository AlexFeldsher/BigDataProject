Hitler is joined by Otto Günsche who informs him on everything even the obvious and pointless, Hans Krebs who has a fetish for maps and fish, Alfred Jodl who objects to every Hitler's plans, Wilhelm Burgdorf who loves to drink booze, Hermann Göring the ever-hungry who likes to devour everything, Joseph \"Skeletor\" Goebbels the ever-loyal but ugly henchman of Hitler among others. Another faction exists within the bunker which was led by Antics master Hermann Fegelein who likes to cause mischief within the bunker. Hitler longs to kill the seemingly-immortal Fegelein but just can't. If not busy dealing with Fegelein, Hitler rants on various mundane stuffs.",
