            "Lesbica is a lesbian mermaid who has turned 16. At that age, tradition tells her to rise to the surface at night, so that through her hypnotic song she shall sink a small boat of humans. Thus, Lesbica manages to wreck a \"Titanic\"; but halfway down she notices the presence of a beautiful young woman who was traveling on the boat. She is none other than the Princess of the Kingdom of Bollo. Lesbica is captivated, and decides to rescue her by taking her unconscious to the shore of the beach. But the next morning, Princess Bollera has not yet awakened, and Lesbica has to hide when a young human approaches the place. Bollera wakes up in the presence of this human who has come to her aid, ignoring who has really rescued her. Lesbica is disconsolate, and ready to clarify everything, she resorts to a marine surgical clinic, in which she will become human to go in search of her beloved terrestrial princess.\"La Sirenita Lesbiana\" is a mini-series of independent youth animation (and spin-off of another series called Mariko Naka), made by the Spanish author Efrayn R.S. in 2008 and published on the Internet in 2009 through \"Efrayn.com\" and \"YouTube\". Arguably it is a version of Hans Christian Andersen's classic, but in a much more direct language and a black humor, sharp and surreal.The success of the series was on the rise for better and for worse, because in 2011, some disgruntled users of YouTube sent notices to report it for the torso nudes of the protagonist and their sexual condition, entering the controversial issue that these 'nudes' and sexual themes are not suitable for a series of animation, a technique that is often wrongly thought to be targeted only toward children. In 2013 it returns in a new self-censored image format and split episodes in shorter duration, available again in the aforementioned platforms."
