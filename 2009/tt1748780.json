        "plot outline": "BLOCK - D is centered on the dramatic and often comical relationships between a colorful group of tenants in an apartment building in Nairobi's Kalifonia estate. The show is a satirical take on their often melodramatic interactions, providing an inside look into the development of community, where strangers become neighbors, friends and maybe even family. There is Clara (Adhiambo Opondo) a young single mother who takes on the difficult task of managing the run down BLOCK D - a rental building where no one wants to pay rent but everyone has a demand they want met. A catalyst for conflict and comedy in the building is the outspoken, busybody Melba (Lucy Nyagah) who is everyone's main source of grief. Nothing is too sacred or private to escape Melba's opinionated commentary. She runs the only grocery store on the Block and will extend store credit only to those who put up with her nosy nature. Her loyal and soft-spoken husband Amos (Ken Ambani) is the perfect foil for his wife's disruptive temper, trying to save face with the neighbors and make amends when she goes too far. Then there is Kim (Betty Wangeshi) who also rents an apartment in the building and runs a hair salon next to Melba's store. This feisty young lady is the only tenant who can beat Melba at her own game. But she can never seem to keep her wayward but charming boyfriend Kilo (George Mo) in line. What she really wants is for them to be a happy couple like their neighbors Ben (Melvin Alusa) and Rita (Janet Kirina). But this young couple has their fair share of struggles as they try to make ends meet often with heartbreaking results. However one cannot help but cheer them on as they face each hurdle with zest. Also starring are Meja (Steenie Njoroge) the mysterious older gentleman who is known to launch into never-ending stories and tall tales when he hits the bottle hard, which is often and Biko (Rogers Otieno) Clara's newly reformed husband whose shadowy past is threatening to shatter the happy family facade.",
