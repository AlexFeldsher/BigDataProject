        "plot outline": "\"Lingerie\" is a sexy new cable series featuring an ensemble cast of beautiful people who design, photograph and model lingerie in New York City's fashion industry. Most of the stories revolve around Lacey Summers, who left a successful modeling career to design lingerie. Lacey lives in a large loft that doubles as her design studio. Her younger brother, Cody, lives a few blocks away with his wing man Russ. What Cody lacks in ambition he makes up for in charm and good looks. He's constantly popping in and out of Lacey's place helping himself to her food and occasionally to her models. Lacey's lingerie is in several NY boutiques yet Lacey struggles to make ends meet as costs for fabrics, photographers and models run higher than her income. To help keep costs down, Lacey decides to rent out her spare room to Vanessa, a beautiful young, want-to-be actress from Seattle. Lacey's best friend, Marilyn, writes for a gossip fashion magazine and does her best to promote Lacey's work, occasionally introducing her to investors and editors who can get her work seen. Unfortunately, one of the investors is more interested in ripping off Lacey's designs than he is in helping her. To complicate an already hectic life, Lacey's on-again-off-again photographer boyfriend, Jason, can't seem to keep his hands off Lacey's models. Jason and Lacey have an open relationship but when Jason sleeps with her new roommate, Vanessa, she realizes she's had enough. She breaks up with Jason and turns her romantic attentions to Rick, a NY City fireman. But Rick finds it hard to relate to Lacey's work. Though he admits he loves to see women in lingerie, he thinks lingerie is only good for as long as it takes a man to remove it from a woman. Rick would rather she go with him on weekend adventures, where they could off-road, climb mountains or camp; however, Lacey's a true city girl and doesn't enjoy the \"great outdoors\". Their relationship soon drifts apart. Lacey decides to take time off from her relationships and devote her energies to creating a new \"Metro\" line of lingerie which she promotes during a New York City Spring Fashion Show.",

            "\"_Lingerie_ (qv)\" is a sexy new cable series featuring an ensemble cast of beautiful people who design, photograph and model lingerie in New York City's fashion industry. Most of the stories revolve around Lacey Summers, who left a successful modeling career to design lingerie. Lacey lives in a large loft that doubles as her design studio. Her younger brother, Cody, lives a few blocks away with his wing man Russ. What Cody lacks in ambition he makes up for in charm and good looks. He's constantly popping in and out of Lacey's place helping himself to her food and occasionally to her models. Lacey's lingerie is in several NY boutiques yet Lacey struggles to make ends meet as costs for fabrics, photographers and models run higher than her income. To help keep costs down, Lacey decides to rent out her spare room to Vanessa, a beautiful young, want-to-be actress from Seattle. Lacey's best friend, Marilyn, writes for a gossip fashion magazine and does her best to promote Lacey's work, occasionally introducing her to investors and editors who can get her work seen. Unfortunately, one of the investors is more interested in ripping off Lacey's designs than he is in helping her. To complicate an already hectic life, Lacey's on-again-off-again photographer boyfriend, Jason, can't seem to keep his hands off Lacey's models. Jason and Lacey have an open relationship but when Jason sleeps with her new roommate, Vanessa, she realizes she's had enough. She breaks up with Jason and turns her romantic attentions to Rick, a NY City fireman. But Rick finds it hard to relate to Lacey's work. Though he admits he loves to see women in lingerie, he thinks lingerie is only good for as long as it takes a man to remove it from a woman. Rick would rather she go with him on weekend adventures, where they could off-road, climb mountains or camp; however, Lacey's a true city girl and doesn't enjoy the \"great outdoors\". Their relationship soon drifts apart. Lacey decides to take time off from her relationships and devote her energies to creating a new \"Metro\" line of lingerie which she promotes during a New York City Spring Fashion Show.::John Quinn"
