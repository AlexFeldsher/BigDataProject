To the north of the Río Fuerte, Sonora's old indigenous nations, especially the Yaquis and the Mayos would be forced to establish a secular battle of resistance: a struggle so great that it stands without comparison to any other struggle of this kind in Mexican history. From the long and violent encounters between white colonizers and Sonora's proud Indians, it is only logical that a strong character and a lively, decisive temperament would surface among Sonora's residents today.",
