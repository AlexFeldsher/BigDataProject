Marion should consider herself lucky, since many never returned. Hoping to make up for lost time, she reconnects with her best friend Pierre. Pierre is living with Julie whom he cares for as a sister. Marion and Pierre go to a special wedding - that of Georges and Italian beauty Anna. They had met each other in the summer of 1944 during the Liberation of Paris. Georges becomes a permanent Communist party member. His commitment to the party and its causes earn him well-deserved promotions rapidly. Meanwhile, Anna is about to give birth to little Francesca. Another principal character's life and career are taking off along with the Communist Party. This is François, who is also making good profits with the increasing sales of the party-sanctioned \"Humanité\" newspaper. Scarred by her wartime suffering, the torture and treachery, Marion is doubtful about re-embracing the Communist ideals. Before she takes any important steps, she needs to find herself again, renew her ideals, her faith and the will to live. Twenty-some years in the lives of these \"comrads\" - between 1944 and the May 1968 riots tell a composite story or history lesson of post WWII French politics focusing on the left wing movements. As individual inter-personal alliances and divisions common in those times occur, the broader picture of compromises, agreements and internal divisions of the left-wing in France unfolds in this three part miniseries.",

            "They are six: three girls and three boys, resistance fighter among the firsts, brave and passionate. Upon the Liberation, they are twenty years old. Everything differentiates them: their social origin, their temper and their ambition. Two things tie them together: communism and friendship. Between 1945 and 1965, society is changing and so are they. Work, couples, children are fights that are won or lost; ideals are jeopardized but friendship is still there, stronger than ever.
