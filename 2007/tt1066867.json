He worked and saved for 30 years in order to afford his own business - 'Panini Cafe' - just off the Edgware road. Now the July 1st blanketsmoking ban, which also bans shisha pipe smoking, threatens to destroy Hassan's cafe and hard won new home in London. Episode Two - 'SHISHA BOYS': Danyal and his friends meet up every day at the biggest shisha smoking cafe on the Edgware Road - 'Shishawi'. They enjoy the alcohol-free and open atmosphere of the cafe, where everything can be debated and discussed. The cafe looks likely to fall victim to the smoking ban and the friends reflect on what they and London will lose - a place where young British Muslims and people from all cultures and creeds could mix freely, and break down stereotypes. The friends also discuss their views on the 7/7 bombings, which hit Edgware Road in 2005.",

            "For centuries Arabic cultures have enjoyed tea-houses, backgammon and smoking 'Shisha' - an ancient tobacco water pipe. However in July 2007 a blanket smoking ban will be imposed in England. The Shisha caf√©s of London's famous Edgware Road that have been the hub of the Arabic community for decades face closure. Businesses, livelihoods and a way of life are now under threat.::Anonymous"
