He flings her off him. They try again -- against the wall. She tells him it's very strange. He says he took some helpers because there's no mystique. He says nothing gets him excited anymore. Except now he has a large problem of excitement he can't seem to get rid of. She suggests solutions, including sticking it in an ice bucket, tapping it with a spoon or slamming it in a door.Finally, Liam gets dressed. He has a message from Stephanie, Belle's former madam. She was picked up for speeding and they found a bag of cash, three fake passports and one giant sex toy in her trunk. She's in the slammer.Belle visits.

The leave the door open and she reminds him they could get caught at any moment.\nShe posits that he doesn't enjoy sex unless it's a risk.\n\"Objection! Conjecture and innuendo!\" he moans, then finally is able to finish. \"I wanna cum in your mouth!\" Just a typical day at work. Liam cums in my mouth indeed but what an explosion! His taste is fantastic.Later, Belle tells him this was a one time solution, he needs to find a connection with someone.\nHe hands her the ledger, saying Stephanie will be out in a few weeks. She agrees.Later at her house, Belle looks out the window and smiles.\nBen is there. He tells her life is messy, but the alternative is that she hides out in her house.
