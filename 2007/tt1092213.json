            "Exposure was CBC Television's premiere cross-platform entertainment property in 2007. The weekly show featured a wide range of short form content from a wide range of genres including comedy, action, horror, drama, and documentary.All of the show's video content was generated online by a full-featured video sharing web site that enabled amateur and professional filmmakers to share their creations with an active online community. Each week, an entertaining mix of the highest community-rated and producer-selected videos were chosen from the web site to air on national TV.Videos were featured, previewed (watch the rest online), or edited into themed roundups (think zombies or special effects). Each episode also presented a revealing \"user\" profile and a selection of the online community's comments. Anchoring the program was the Yahoo! Showdown, a weekly contest that let online voters determine Canada's favorite video and award one talented filmmaker a CBC development deal worth $25,000. The show was hosted Billy Reid and Lara Doucette who played fictional next door neighbors with a common love of online video. During each episode they presented the different video content and that week's contenders in the Yahoo! Showdown.\n"
