This particular series ran from 2007-2014 and featured a Sesame Street-like atmosphere with puppets interacting with people in various sets. The concept was several sets which represented regions of Canada, each with their own 'home' puppet character. Patty Sullivan and Sid Bobb were the human hosts. The sets extended from Peggy's Cove, where Captain Claw made his home, Kensington Market in Toronto where Mamma Yamma lived, the Chateau Frontenac where Saumon de Champlain resided, and a tree-fort in the forests of B.C. where Patty and Sid had a home base. Featuring nearly 1000 interstitial segments focused on education and music, Kids' Canada was very well received and was nominated for numerous awards during its run from 2007-2014.",
