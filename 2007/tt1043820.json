            "_Storm Hawks_ (qv) is set in a fantastical world where squadrons of high-flying Sky Knights battle to protect their air turf. Five mismatched teens have found the wreckage of legendary sky knight squadron The _Storm Hawks_ (qv), and now, armed with transforming flying motorcycles, these punks are dog-fighting some of the nastiest villains ever to hit the skies. Too young for fear (or a pilot's license), the new _Storm Hawks_ (qv) are burning rubber and cracking rudders on a tailspin adventure that will take your breath away... or just make you lose your lunch!::Anonymous"
