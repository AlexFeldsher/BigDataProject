            "_Ride with the Devil_ (qv) is a high octane drama with a unique Asian slant. It is fast moving, fuelled by the realities of contemporary New Zealand, and features really cool cars. It is the story of Lin (Andy Wong), a student from Shanghai, and the friendship he develops with Kurt Williams (Xavier Horan), a testosterone-fueled Kiwi guy from the suburbs of Auckland. The unlikely pair meet because of their shared love of performance cars, though Kurt's motives in befriending the wealthy young immigrant at first are purely exploitative. But when a late night street race goes horribly wrong and the cops are looking for culprits, these boy racers are in it together.::Isola Productions",
            "Lin is a young Asian man recently flown in from Beijing. Cast out by his rich father he ends up n the City of Sails under the strict guidance of his Aunt. His cousin Amy leads two lives - one of perfect student the other the leader of an all girl Boy Racer crew. Almost impossible to own a car where he is from, Lin is drawn into the world of late night cruising, drift comps, and other assortment's of auto erotica. Lin meets up with Kurt, a south Auckland hoon who has done time and come out the other side. Kurt is the \"design engineer: for B-bay Motors, a hip-hop styled fast fours import workshop (they do up Jap cars). At first Kurt sees Lin as a cash cow, the dumb chink with the Gold card. Kurt promises Lin his own car fame and glory and a strange kinship grows over a few cups of octane-fuelled craziness. The unholy alliance becomes damned forever when a street race kills innocent people and the cops come looking for the culprits. Boy Racers are the scourges of society to some and being Asian only makes it worse. But despite conrods from gods own garage being thrown in the cylinder heads, the two young men attempt to keep themselves and their friendship alive::Anonymous"
