But for every brilliant creation, there are thousands that never get off the drawing board. However, not all failed inventions are indeed failures. The Re-Inventors follows Matt Hunter and Jeremy MacPherson as they dig up original patent designs from historys lost inventions and, for the first known time build them, test them, and try to make them work. Some designs will crash and burn, but a few others might actually prove brilliant when given a chance. Armed with blow torches and history books, they take us through the strange and entertaining world of invention, proving human beings will try to build just about anything."
