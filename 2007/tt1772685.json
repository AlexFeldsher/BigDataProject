            "A lively, big-hearted tomboy in Seoul named Go Eun Chan works several jobs to support her mother and sister. When Choi Han Kyul, handsome and irresponsible scion of a wealthy family, meets Go Eun Chan, he mistakes her for a young man, and she does not correct him. Han Kyul is resisting his grandmothers pressure to go into business and to marry. Although Han Kyul and Eun Chan get off on the wrong foot, Han Kyul hires her to pose as his gay lover, in order to scare off the young women with whom his grandmother tries to match him up. The grandmother threatens to stop Han Kyuls allowance unless he proves himself by turning around a failing coffee shop. Choi Han Kyul decides to hire only good-looking men in order to attract female customers. He hires Go Eun Chan, who now must keep her gender secret or lose her job. Meanwhile, beautiful and successful artist Han Yoo Joo returns to Seoul to reunite with her long-time lover Choi Han Sung, who is Han Kyuls cousin. Han Kyul has long carried a torch for Yoo Joo. When both Choi cousins begin to have feelings for Eun Chan, and she for them, things get complicated particularly for Han Kyul, who begins to question his sexual orientation."
