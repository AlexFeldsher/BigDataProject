        "plot outline": "The recent disorders and rampant criminal activities break the serenity of Qingshui city, posing a major threat to Qingshui people's safety. Yet Qin Zhijian and a number of upright policemen are at the end of their resources to put down the criminal activities. At this crucial point, Lin Yin is appointed as chief of Public Security Bureau. Yet what he doesn't know is that the whole Qingshui town has fallen under the control of a syndicate organization led by Zheng Guangjun, who has established a powerful network from top to bottom, including secretary of municipal party committee, mayor, secretary of Politics and Law Committee, the deputy chief of Public Security, head of criminal affairs detachment, and ordinary policemen. A syndicate organization, which consists of underground government, organization department, court and police station, has begun to emerge. Meanwhile, a large number of narcotic drugs are shipped out of Qingshui Town. Sky falls; murders are rampant; social orders are falling apart. Lin Ying's only choice is to do everything to crack down the criminal network. However, Lin Yin himself is also faced with the coercion of the underground organization. In this battle, who will prevail? And the price of losing is life and honor. Even a slight move in one part will encounter the resistance of all the evil forces in Qingshui.",
