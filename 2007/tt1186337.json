The rich fishing are made unreliable by El Niño, so the key is diversified agriculture at various heights, where corn and potato species grow, on artificial terraces to irrigate mountain streams. The key animal, llama, provided transport over a vast road network, meat and wool. They built in stone, withstanding most earthquakes. Their downfall at Spanish hands was also motivated by a geological treasure: gold.    "
