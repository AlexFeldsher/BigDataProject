Leo owes much of his success to Gina's exceptional cooking, but since leaving her for the glamorous Sam, his business has continued to thrive. When Sam has suspicions that Leo is having an affair she confides in Gina, confident that she'll recognize the signs. Only to later discover that it's Gina herself who is the 'other woman'. The secrets and scandals that spill out are proof that sleeping with another woman's husband is never a good idea - even if he was your husband first. As Sam and Gina try to fix their broken families, will a friendship rise from the ashes of betrayal or will they tear each other apart?",
