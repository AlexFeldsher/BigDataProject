            "For almost 120 years, Country Life magazine has been aspiring to capture the elusive soul of the British countryside, from muddy fields to stately homes. Jane Treays spent a year filming with the magazine, exploring the lives of those who have been bred into the land, inherited it or have simply bought into its dreams.From a 'girl in pearls' shoot in Yorkshire to a historic mansion in Dorset, via Lindisfarne castle and a family farm in Somerset, this series captures the glory and eccentricity of the men and women who live the rural life."
