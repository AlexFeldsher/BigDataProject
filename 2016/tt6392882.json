Nevertheless, the twins are among the most successful insurance brokers in the country. The brothers cultivate a sometimes harsh tone, but the heart is always in the right place. In addition to creative solutions in the event of damage, the musty-looking twins always have time for a cup of coffee and a chat about the everyday worries of their customers. When everything is too wild, the longtime employee Maggie brings peace to the store again. Whether life insurance, comprehensive insurance or life insurance - whenever the insurance is concerned with the sausage, the family company is the first contact for many people in and around Bochum.",
