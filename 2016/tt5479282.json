            "Directed by Kiel McNaughton, \"This is Piki\" is a Maori drama series produced by well known actor Cliff Curtis, also featuring Temurea Morrison, most often recognized for his role as \"Jake Heke\" in the powerful drama \"Once Were Warriors\". Another of a growing list of series and films in which the Maori language is front and center, \"This is Piki\" has been welcomed as a vehicle in which indigenous peoples, such as Pacific Islanders, present and represent themselves: their cultures, stories, identities and histories. Also playing a central role is Tia Maipi, the main actor in \"Born to Dance\", along with many other experienced Maori and Polynesian actors such as Calvin Tuteao from \"The Last Saint\", among other films. Slated as being an eight-part series, 30 minutes each episode, there is a central focus of core characters with varied themes."
