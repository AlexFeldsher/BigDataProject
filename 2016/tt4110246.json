            "Mother. Dancer. Courtesan. Spy. The incredible true story of an extraordinary woman.\nMata Hari is an epic drama that charts the extraordinary life of exotic dancer, courtesan and infamous spy Mata Hari.\nTo her audiences, Mata Hari was the notorious performer and dancer. To her wealthy lovers she was the charming yet mysterious seductress. To both the German and French Intelligence Services she was an invaluable and trustworthy informant who was exposed as a double agent. But few saw Margaret Zelle, the real woman behind the legend of Mata Hari.\nBorn of humble beginnings, Margaret escapes personal family tragedy and a loveless marriage to become the most controversial woman of her Age. But for all her fame and wealth, she cannot forget the daughter that was taken away from her.\nDesperately driven to be reunited with her child, Margaret seeks to win favour with anyone powerful enough to help her; by using her mind, her information, or her body. But as the world descends towards war, and as the stakes get higher than she could ever have imagined, Margaret is no longer sure which side she is on. Her life has become a performance that she cannot escape from.\nThis landmark new drama about love, loss and defiance features an acclaimed international cast including Christopher Lambert (Ghost Rider 2, Highlander), John Corbett (Sex and the City, My Big Fat Greek Wedding), Rutger Hauer (Batman Begins, Blade Runner), Gerard Depardieu (Life of Pi, La Vie en Rose) and French actress Vahina Giocante (99 Francs, The Libertine) as Mata Hari. Mata Hari is directed by Dennis Berry (Highlander, Stargate SG-1) and Julius Berg."
