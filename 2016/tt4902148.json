Everything on the surface seems pretty normal until Marcus begins to have nightmares about him murdering other individuals. With the help of his therapist, Doctor Kent Stone, he is able to cope with the idea that it's only a dream. Though he is accepting of the idea, other situations are telling him otherwise. Marcus begins an internal battle of what's real and whats not. Paranoia begins to make him feel as if he is being watched. As the story unfolds we will uncover that Marcus is only a pawn in one of the biggest government conspiracies in history.",
