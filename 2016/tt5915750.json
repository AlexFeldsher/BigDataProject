            "The story opens with 17-year-old Robin approaching the Sophie's father after discovering the news of Sophie's disappearance. He decides to take matters into his own hands along with the help of his reluctant friend Ellie. Like-minded people are enlisted to help him find his friend. Robin and Ellie invest in a social media campaign entitled '_Let's Bring Back Sophie_ (qv)' to implore people to consider any potential darker circumstances surrounding her disappearance and allowing others to get involved in their cause. Among the people who show interest are: obnoxious and quick-witted Thomas; reserved and resourceful Alexander; and brother-sister pairing Sniper and Nicole (who have a dark dynamic entirely of their own). Every episode will feature a different protagonist, allowing the audience to explore the characters' past and why they found it necessary to help.::Edward Fleming"
