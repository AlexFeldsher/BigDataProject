Her father, whom she loves dearly, is terminally ill, and her relationship with her husband, Sergey is growing cold. When her father eventually dies, Lena is inconsolable. Her step-sister Natasha, whom she has not seen for many years, helps her to overcome her grieving as best she can, and gradually, Lena's life returns to normal. Soon afterwards, however, life deals Lena another blow, when she realizes that her husband has been cheating on her. Sergey denies it and tells Lena that she is mistaken. Lena starts to think that she is going crazy, and when she has a nervous breakdown, Sergey calls a psychiatrist who confirms that the poor woman is on the verge of madness due to all the stress she has been through. One morning Lena awakes to the smell of smoke only to see that the bath house in her yard has burnt down. Furthermore her husband's dead body is found inside. Accused of Sergey's murder, and with all the evidence pointing to her guilt, Lena finds herself in prison. But she is the only person to know the truth: she was framed, she did not kill her husband. Now she faces the daunting prospect of having to convince the court, not to mention her family and friends, of her innocence at all costs.",
