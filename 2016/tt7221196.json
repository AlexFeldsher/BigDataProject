At that historical moment, any agglomeration of people in a public space could be considered as a potential target of political repression. The population was therefore forced to always remain inside private spaces, what created a culture of confinement. In recent years, initiatives of urban interventionism have increased exponentially, being encouraged by democratic public administrations. The grayish city of Sao Paulo is the stage for this series. Through ludic and socially responsible performances, these artistic collectives use the public space as a means to stimulate the population to reoccupy a territory which has always belonged to them: the streets.",
