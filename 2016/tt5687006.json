            "German entertainer and musician Friedrich Liechtenstein - the most surprising internet star who has become world famous since the release of his song and commercial \"Supergeil\" - doesn't just rest on his 15 million hits on YouTube, bathing in the flood of \"Likes\" from all over the world. Quite the contrary, Mr. Liechtenstein and his signature tailored suits, golden fingernails and full white beard are already on a new mission: Instead of \"supergeil\" the word is now: \"super filled-up\".As strange as it might sound, Friedrich Liechtenstein is searching for happiness at the most unusual sites: at Gas Stations. He wants to convince the world of gas stations being today's most romantic places.The 10-piece TV-series \"Gasoline Deluxe\" follows the entertainer travelling in an golden vintage Mercedes across Europe - always in search of the most beautiful, most extraordinary gas stations. Needless to mention that this journey is not just about pumping gas, but about the scent of freedom, about meeting charismatic fellow artists, critical economists, futurologists and historians as well as tired truck drivers, lovey-dovey couples and lonely commuters.Gas Stations are the places to be - at least for Friedrich Liechtenstein. The anonymity of the transit allow elusive but truthful encounters with the most diverse protagonists: The owner of one of the oldest backyard gas stations in Vienna saw the city and their inhabitants change over the past 84 years. Consuelo Vanderbilt-Costin, dressed in a snow-white gown coincidentally drops by at an iconic gas station in Berlin and Liechtenstein can't wait to help pumping her gas. The notorious Fiat heir Lapo Elkann is eager to show Liechtenstein an exclusive insight into his rebuilding of the \"Garage Italia\", a famous historic gas station in Milan. Léa Linster, the Michelin-starred chef from Luxemburg, welcomes Friedrich Liechtenstein at the former gas station of her father - now her top restaurant - to cook with him. There is dancing on gas stations, science-fiction performances, and the beauty of everyday routines happening at gas stations.\"Gasoline Deluxe\" is an elegant, as well as crazy journey between fiction and reality, a tribute to the non-places and of course to traveling. Last but not least, it is a symbolic embrace of a place that's about to vanish.The journey in 10 episodes:"
