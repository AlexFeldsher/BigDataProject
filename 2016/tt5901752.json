            "When a disillusioned uni-grad and a jaded army vet discover they have super-human abilities, and begin to use their powers for evil acts, a young rogue detective decides to go on the hunt for a new super-human, who may or may not be sympathetic to his cause.",
            "Three volunteers enter into a scientific study, with the promise of a hefty sum of cash from an international pharmaceutical company. It's a secret trial to strengthen the human body to new levels; to eradicate the danger of emerging super bug resistance to antibiotics. Sponsored by the British Government, the company employees nickname it...'The Three Lions programme'. The test subjects are all down on their luck, and desperately in need of a financial boost: a jaded war torn soldier, a history graduate crippled under loan debt, and a troubled young ex-convict who's doing her best to stay on the straight and narrow. The experiment yields a zero response rate from all three, and the programme is dropped. One year later, the three test subjects begin to discover that they have gained special abilities. All in different situations now, they all respond to these new powers in their own unique way. The directionless uni grad goes public with their status as a 'gifted' human being. After being a darling of the tabloid press initially, she is eventually taken in for government scientific 'study' and becomes a glorified, caged lab rat. When the now super-powered army vet breaks her out of captivity and persuades her to join his dark cause, a young rogue detective decides to go on the hunt to unearth the third test subject, the ex-con, and convince them to use their powers for good, to prevent disastrous consequences for the nation, and the world."
