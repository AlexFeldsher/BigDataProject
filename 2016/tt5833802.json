Our main aim is to promote Irish musicians and help creative people in showcasing their talents on television. During 2005, we decided to set up a program in Tramore, Co. Waterford. What encouraged us to develop this community program, was that we thought Tramore was such a quiet place and there were little social activities offered for the youth within community development at the weekends. We thought that by offering a social event every weekend it would help benefit the community. Our activities and the shows we organized were able to bring both the Irish and the migrants of the community together and furthermore helped to enhance the cultural interests between the two different cultures through entertainment. In 2006 we thought of the possibility of expanding it into a nationwide program due to the encouragement and positive feedback from the public in response to our programs, hence we have traveled to sixteen counties within Ireland portraying our ideas. To date, we have achieved our main aim, to be able to broadcast our program on Sky platform and also be able to achieve our permanent production resident studio that includes a live audience, production equipment and professional men and women trained in the field, working with our organization.",
