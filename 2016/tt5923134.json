Shivin and Ahan were best friends until a series of miscommunication caused Ahan to get angry on Shivin, although it was never his fault. This causes Shivin to get angry on his mother thinking it is her fault, but the truth is she is also innocent. Gauri bumps into Ahan a few times, so they start to lightly recognize each other. On the other hand, Gauri and Shivin meets through some misunderstandings which causes Gauri to have a bad image of Shivin, but in reality, Shivin is a very down-to-earth guy who cares for people. The misunderstanding is soon sorted out when Shivin saves Gauri from goons and shelters her for a while in his house.",
