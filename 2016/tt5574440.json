Many veteran experiences will be captured as keepsakes for the veterans as well as a vehicle to share their stories, experiences and testimonials with the public at large via our TV program. Our message then is simply to offer hope and healing to unseen casualties of wartime service at a pivotal time when their worlds seem hopeless.",
