These teenagers are thrust into the wildly competitive world of ballet where they will perfect their craft as young performers. Living together in the school dormitories and rehearsing under rigorous deadlines, this group of elite teen dancers will immediately form lasting friendships with each other. Set in the bustling backdrop of New York City, this groundbreaking series will tell the diverse and compelling stories of this team of young Big Apple transplants who all share the same life-long dream- to become a professional dancer.",
