Supported by nations around the globe, the International Space Station supports science and research on how humans can survive in the cosmos, laying the ground work for journeys well beyond our own planet.

NASA and its international partners adopted a similar model when conceiving humanity's first International Space Station. They utilized the intelligence and resources of nations from around the globe.    "
