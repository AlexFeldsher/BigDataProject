Despite this staggering number, the deadly venom is also used to save lives in the production of anti-venom. There's a problem though: anti-venom supplies are dwindling every year, making the stakes even higher for brave professionals who harvest this equally deadly and precious substance. New Discovery series VENOM HUNTERS will follow four brave teams of expert snake hunters who have the guts and skills to chase down the world's most venomous snakes and collect this highly toxic liquid. Each team has unique motivations and thrives on the thrill of the hunt, but they all share the same goal: saving the lives of others. The series premiere of VENOM HUNTERS debuts Wednesday, Feb. 17 at 10/9c on Discovery. From the Florida swamplands and the plains of Oklahoma, to the Australian outback and Arizona desert, the fearless venom experts will put their lives on the line to track, catch and harvest the venom from these deadly reptiles. The demand for venom is at an all-time high as it is now being used to not only create anti-venom, but also as a key part of cutting-edge medical research that aims to treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and even cancer. With over 600 species of venomous snakes worldwide, these hunters will be risking their lives with every step - one wrong move could be their last.",
