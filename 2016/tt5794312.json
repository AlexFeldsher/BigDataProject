A diagnosis has revealed that Nicolas has leukemia and that he'll need a bone marrow transplant urgently. It is with this visit that Fabian learns he has a son, and that he is the boy's only hope. What begins as a surgical intervention becomes a powerful and intimate bond between a father and his child - a boy who is unaware he was adopted. Fabian's nobility and love not only moves the young boy, but also Isidora, whose happiness he has helped restore. The intense attraction between Isidora and Fabian eventually provokes a fervent family war, breaking away with everything they've built and redefining the foundations of their lives.",
