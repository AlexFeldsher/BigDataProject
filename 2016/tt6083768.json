With the help of the YouTube community, Chloe is able to discover clues within the odd video that set her on the trail of her long-lost sister, Madison. As the community has grown, Chloe has been sent more and more videos, each with more complex puzzles that lead her further down a rabbit hole of conspiracy and occultism. Chloe's pursuit of her sister has been shaped by the YouTube community, as they've discovered clues and potential places of interest that Chloe never expected to find. The community has stepped up and aided Chloe in a dangerous, tense investigation that has spanned multiple continents. Now, having finally met with her sister, Chloe discovers that the road to saving her sister, and herself, is going to be a lot harder than anyone could have guessed... and the only way she'll survive is with the community's help.",
