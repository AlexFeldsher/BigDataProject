She spends her days working on her art and hanging out with her best friend Simon Lewis (Alberto Rosende). When the two head out to the Pandemonium Club, Clary sees a murder that no one else can see or will believe. When Clary returns home she is attacked by a demon but luckily the Shadowhunters find her and save her. When they discover that Clary is a Shadowhunter herself, Jace Wayland (Dom Sherwood), Alec (Matthew Daddario), and Izzy (Emeraude Toubia) Lightwood help her discover herself and find Clary's mother who was kidnapped. Jocelyn's best friend, Luke Garroway (Isaiah Mustafa), has also suddenly turned his back on her. With the help of the Silent Brothers, Magnus Bane (Harry Shum Jr.)- the High Warlock of Brooklyn, and the Shadowhunter resources like the Institute and one of its caretakers (Hodge Starkweather played by Jon Cor); Clary must discover herself while possibly saving the Shadowrealm from her father (Alan Van Sprang) who turns out to be a once powerful cult leader.
