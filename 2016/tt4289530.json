            "'Blind Justice' is set in the fictional town of Redfort, NSW, Australia... Where a serial killer nicknamed 'The Judge' is on the loose and people keep turning up dead... but these killings aren't like any other the Redfort Police have ever seen... all the people that have fallen victim to 'The Judge' are ex-criminals who have been released through our soft, otherwise corrupt judicial system. 'The Judges' M.O (modus operandi) is that all the victims seem to die from a suspected heart attack, but are left out in the open for the police to find... They all have the Scales of Justice burnt in their bodies with a white blind fold on, signifying 'BLIND JUSTICE'. The main story is based around Jaxon Michaels, who was once a devoted husband to Stacey Michaels and a loving father to Caitlyn Michaels; that is until a chain of ill-fated, un-related events occur... Stacey passes aw ay after a long struggle with cancer, leaving Jaxon to raise a 10 year old Caitlyn on his own... A year passes and whilst still trying to come to terms with their new life without Stacey, Caitlyn begs her farther to leave her at home whilst he goes to the shops... Jaxon, realizing she needs to feel some self-independence after her mum died, submits to her... However upon his return home, he finds the door unlocked and slightly open... What he finds next is the definition of unimaginable for any parent to... Caitlyn's blood stained clothes strewn throughout the lounge room, and her lifeless body on the ground... The paedophile and killer, Travis Burford, is quickly picked up by police only a few blocks from Jaxon's house and he is placed behind bars for the rape and murder of Caitlyn Michaels. A few months pass and for the first time in his life, Jaxon now finds himself in complete and utter desolation. Feeling that some form of justice has been served to Travis, an d knowing that there is nothing he can do to get to Travis behind bars, Jaxon begins to try acceptance to move on from the horrific place he has now found himself in. However this is shortly lived as Jaxon, not wanting to survive in the world alone, turns to drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of losing his child and his wife. Jaxon begins on a downward spiral out of control, until he is admitted into Redfort psychiatric hospital, where he begins meetings with his Psychiatrist. Kendal Williams... Only problem is Jaxon and Kendall have a history together that they must keep a secret otherwise it would be classed as a conflict of interest. A few months pass and Jaxon and Kendall's meeting have really been helping Jaxon deal with his grief and learn to accept what has happened to him, and he is slowly learning that moving on and accepting doesn't mean caring any less or forgetting about them. As Jaxon is on the road to recovery, he soon finds out, that Travis Burford h as been released from prison on a technicality after his appeal process. Jaxon now filled with rage, hatred and alcohol, goes to Travis' house to confront him... Shortly after, Detective Sonia Vasquez and Detective Chris Davies, go to Travis' house to find Jaxon standing above Travis' dead body... Jaxon is arrested and taken to the police station and placed in a room for questioning... The detectives' question Jaxon, who has the motive of a lifetime, in what is an intense and gruelling interrogation scene... But did Jaxon really kill? Is Jaxon really 'The Judge', or is he protecting someone else? Blind Justice will get you questioning your own morals and beliefs... Could the pain of losing your child, lead someone to kill... an eye for an eye? Or is acceptance the key to moving on? Well for some, when acceptance isn't enough, there is always... 'BLIND JUSTICE'."
