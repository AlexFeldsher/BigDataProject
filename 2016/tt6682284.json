Our team takes you along on their urban adventure to uncover the secrets of the hard to access locations. Urban exploration is a hobby that comes with inherent dangers and extreme situations may present themselves at any turn. Unstable structures, unsafe floors, chemical hazards, stray voltage - there's a lot to overcome to make it to the bottom of that abandoned tunnel or to scale that building. Yet once you get in on the secret workings of the city and get to know the obscure spaces that are normally neglected, it makes it all worth it. It's time to stop being oblivious to the urban wonders around us. Open a door, cross a fence, or sneak into a hole with our team and you have left the normal world, you are exploring.
