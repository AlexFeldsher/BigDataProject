            "What do a narsissistic mother, a bisexual politician, a misfit, a drug addict, and a cops wife all have in common? They all seem to be connected to a serial killer known as the silver bells killer. The mystery unfolds as we discover this wealthy disfunctional family's secrets.",
            "They seem like the perfect family: wealthy Boston blue-bloods, a mansion, they are all attractive and full of grace ... Only one problem. One of them is a serial killer knows as \"silver bells killer\". In the wake of thier fathers death, all fingers are pointing in different directions. Who done it? The sociopathic mother? The misfit loner? The drug addict? The bisexual politician? Or the wife of the detective trying to crack the case. With a family this disfunctional, it's really hard to tell who is innocent .",
            "The Hawthornes are a nouveau riche and well respected family in Boston, their money largely from patriarch Mitchell Hawthorne's concrete business. That respect now extends to the next generation, Mitchell and Madeline Hawthorne's eldest daughter, Alison Hawthorne-Price, a city councilor who has decided to take a run for mayor in the next election with the support of her parents and her businessman husband, Tom Price, they the poster children for good looking marriage perfection. But there is a still hidden skeleton in Alison and Tom's closet, and some other skeletons related to her family: her older brother, Garrett Hawthorne, abandoned the family twenty years ago under mysterious circumstances, never to be seen or heard from again; and her younger brother and his estranged wife, Cam and Sophie Hawthorne, are known drug addicts. Just as the election campaign begins, another problem emerges for the entire Hawthorne family: the concrete business is implicated in a twenty year cold case, that of a serial murderer coined the Silver Bells Killer (SBK), with Mitchell, Madeline, Garrett and Cam most specifically of the Hawthorne family members suspected as possibly being SBK. Brady Ross, a homicide detective with the Boston PD, is among those investigating this new lead, he who is trying to make a name for himself with this case. What complicates the situation even more is that Brady is married to Tessa Ross, Garrett, Alison and Cam's youngest sister.::Huggo"
