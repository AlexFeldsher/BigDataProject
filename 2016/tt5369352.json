            "_Eyewitness_ (qv), an American adaptation of the Norwegian series Øyevitne, follows the lives of two teenage boys who stumble upon a triple homicide, whilst in a cabin together. At the risk of a small town finding out about their secret love affair, the two boys have no choice but to keep silent about the dreadful incident. However, as time goes by, the two boys find it almost impossible to remain silent. They try their best to forget the incident, but their fear grows as uncertainty rises of whether or not the perpetrator could be after them."
