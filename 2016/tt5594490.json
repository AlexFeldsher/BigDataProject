Fortunately, Andie has her three best friends to help her shake the little sister stigma; Dakota (Rickey Thompson) the sassy gay, Imogen (Brooke Markham) the fresh-out-of-home-school virgin, and Courtney (Meghan Falcone), Alecs girlfriend and last years homecoming queen, who cant let go of her high school days. These four very different personalities help each other navigate the hormone-induced, angst-filled sea that is high school. Directed by Amy York Rubin.\n"
