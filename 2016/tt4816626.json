            "A struggle for power and control set in the rugged and mysterious hills of Appalachia, \"_Outsiders_ (qv)\" tells the story of the Farrell clan, a family of outsiders who've been in these parts since before anyone can remember. Living off the grid and above the law on their mountaintop homestead, they'll protect their world and defend their way of life using any means necessary.::WGN America",
            "The series portrays the Farrell clan as they fight for independence and control over their land in the Appalachian mountains in Kentucky, where their ancestors have lived more than 200 years. The Farrells chose a life in the woods, atop Shay Mountain in extreme isolation from the (fictional) town below of Blackburg, Crockett County, Kentucky. An eviction notice was posted at the entrance of the mountain by the mining company that seeks to begin mining their claimed mountain. All the while a power struggle is taking place within the Farrells, including what may lead to a change of leadership.::Billy Lewis",
            "Lil Foster returns alone after losing his wife to claim his rightful Leadership to the clan. Since his pa took it by killing his ma, and Gwin manipulated her leadership practically the same way. Lil Foster is the only one with truth and honor to take rightful leadership! Gwin still loves him. Plan maybe to move up deeper into the mountain to protect themselves from the mining company, while at the same time reinforcing their land from outsiders. The town of Blackburg becomes more empathetic to the clan because of what the mining company is doing. Hasil still fighting for his child and Sally Ann to be a part of the clan.::Tammy"
