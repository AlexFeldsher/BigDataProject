            "NEXT... is a six part web series that follows the adventures of Tobias (a date addict) and his best friend Penny (a date phobic) and is set in Melbourne Australia. The title refers to a dating app both Tobias and Penny are constantly using in the series. Quirky and entertaining NEXT... the web series will have you reaching for your iPhone to see who is online after watching each episode. A real highlight is the soundtrack performed by Michael Meeking and his band."
