            "Live fast ride slow is the moniker of these man boy drunkards. Which is quite fitting as it's also the motto of the same named gang in the Simpsons cartoon/ television show. Originality is the last thing you'll find in this bro-fest. This show could actually be an extended commercial for Pabst Blue Ribbon beer or a sad psa for stupidity. These ding dongs are living an early aughts cliche`. My only hope is after seeing what will surely be a nationwide hit show, the throngs of people planning a move to the recently labeled \"Very hip\" Richmond, VA will be dissuaded by the antics of these locals.::John"
