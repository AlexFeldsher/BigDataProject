Things begin to go sideways for Daisy when she witnesses a murder she thinks is gang-related, only to find herself slowly drawn into an interconnected web of criminal and illicit sexual activity that reaches into the corridors of corporate and political power. It's the kind of story that will destroy lives, including those of her own family. With help from lead homicide detective Kevin Lutz (Lyriq Bent), her editor Mary Foster (Alex Kingston) and co-worker Simon Olenski (Lucas Bryant), Daisy uncovers a cover-up so scandalous it could bring down the government.",

            "A young journalist who, while working on her first murder case, becomes embroiled in a web of urban gangs, the political class, corporate power-brokers and the police.",
            "The series follows Daisy Channing (Elyse Levesque), a young reporter trying to balance a messy personal life with a burgeoning career. Things begin to go sideways for Daisy when she witnesses a murder she thinks is gang-related, only to find herself slowly drawn into an interconnected web of criminal and illicit sexual activity that reaches into the corridors of corporate and political power. It's the kind of story that will destroy lives, including those of her own family. With help from lead homicide detective Kevin Lutz (Lyriq Bent), her editor Mary Foster (Alex Kingston) and co-worker Simon Olenski (Lucas Bryant), Daisy uncovers a cover-up so scandalous it could bring down the government.::AnonymousB"
