He desperately wants to be there for his aging mother and teenage daughter, Lili, who are back home in Canada. Luckily, video chat allows them to stay connected. They chat about their daily lives and share their views and concerns. Between Lili's homework, Mani's stressful job and Granny's secret life, we are privy to their musings on Iranian kebabs, religion, their family history, slang and customs from both sides of the pond. Their views, representative of both their age and environment, clash in funny yet moving ways in this series that depicts how different people experience multi-ethnicity and explores how values are handed down from one generation to the next. Throughout the episodes, we realize that technical difficulties are not the only reason connecting can be hard.",
