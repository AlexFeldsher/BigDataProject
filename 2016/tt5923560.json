            "In order to save her son Paul (Aleksey Mitin) from the juvenile colony, Antonina (Elena Valyushkina) is forced to abandon her ten-year-old daughter Marina (Evgeniya Loza). It is her former husband (Anatoliy Lobotskiy) who puts the woman before such a dramatic choice. However, years later, Antonina bitterly realizes that her sacrifice was in vain. Having lost the daughter, she was still unable to save her son - Paul took a low road. Her daughter Marina became a judge and could never forgive her mother and believes she was the source of all her troubles. And Antonina is relentlessly tormented by guilt. She cannot let herself be happy, unless her daughter forgives her. But, despite all Antoninas the efforts, her daughters hatred only grows stronger. In a little while an accident occurs to Marina - one of her former criminal defendants, looking for revenge, attacks and causes her multiple stab wounds. Doctors forecasts are not promising: Marina will remain bedridden. In the depth of despair, she asks her mother to help her to die. Will Antonina find strength to fulfil her daughters request, without getting her forgiveness?"
