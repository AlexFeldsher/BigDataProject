        "synopsis": [
            "ON THE RUN! is a fast-paced and adventurous format with high stakes. The target and the chasers all want to win the race. Not just because there's money at stake, but because they want to get bragging rights. They all want to be the best, the smartest and the fastest.At the top of the episode, the target is dropped at an unknown location. The only information the target gets is in an envelope: a EUR1000 budget and a map with this episode's final destination and three mandatory checkpoints. The race is on from the get-go, as the target has a 60 minute lead on the chasers. Can the target outrun and outsmart them?The chasers are dropped at the same location exactly 60 minutes later. They have the same EUR1000 budget, but they only know the final destination for this race. During their 48 hour non-stop chase, they can only rely on their own extensive experience and the local's information to track down the target before he reaches the final destination.Every episode revolves around one race. The same event is told from two different perspectives: from the target and from the chasers. In both cases, the tone of voice is urgent. But whereas the target tries to keep a low profile and travel through the landscapes, cities and villages without being seen, the chasers have a high profile and hope to get help from the locals to track down their target!We use this switching of perspectives to intensify the feeling of action in RUN! For instance, when the chasers are getting closer and closer, we switch to the target's perspective for a heightened sense of paranoia. Every footstep the target hears, every cracking twig on the ground, every local passing by: everything and everyone can signal the end of the race. Because behind every tree lurks the unknown and thus danger. This tension is reinforced with graphics. A map of the area where you can see how far the distance between target and chasers is. For example, an overview of the speed of both parties, to see who's outrunning who. We also emphasize the time pressure with graphics: how much time has passed? How many miles do they still have to cover? Can they even make it at the pace they're going?We use the footage shot during the couple of hours of recon prior to the race to intercut at certain moments in the game. When the target finds out what his chasers have been planning, or when the chasers receive valuable information because of their recon mission. Using distinctive graphics, it's always clear to the viewer they're watching a flashback."
