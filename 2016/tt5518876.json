Their journey will lead them to some of the most remote places in this country and force them to challenge their strength and spirit. The team hails from Toronto but, with backstories of their own, Brian Cauley and Andrea Wrobel each bring a uniqueness to the series that won't be found in many mountaineering tales. An expected three-year journey ending in summiting the sixth highest most prominent peak in the world - Mount Logan - friends and followers will witness The Peakbaggers go from novice climbers to expert mountaineers (We hope!). The journey will be tough, but through some vigorous training, education, tomfoolery, and planning, they will bag each peak.",
