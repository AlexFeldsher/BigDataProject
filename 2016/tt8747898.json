One episode explores 'breath play', a potentially lethal sexual practice involving the restriction of oxygen to the brain to ask why people do it and what experts think. One film joins David, who is unlocking his chastity belt after 100 days. In other episodes we explore where consent lies when you opt not to use a safe word and we uncover extreme role-playing and people who use racial abuse for sexual pleasure and how this kind of behavior can lead to cultural contradictions and moral dilemmas.",
