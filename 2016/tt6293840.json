For some time, however, as he has not been coming up with any new and exciting plans, he has been acting as manager of the company's small staff of employees. Maksim has a fiancée, Tamara, but the truth is he is still in love with his first school romance, Larissa who did not have the patience to wait for his return from military service and married his best friend instead. In the midst of an important deal Maksim learns that his beloved Larissa has died, and so he leaves for his home village to bid farewell to her. There he learns that he has a teenage daughter, Zhenia. Maksim decides to take her back to the city to live with him, because there is no future for her in the village. However, Zhenia does not relate well to her father or his fiancée, and, when she starts school, she cannot get on with her classmates and teachers either. Her life takes a rapid downward turn. Desperate to help Zhenia, Maksim invites Victoria, her teacher and friend from the village school, to come to the city. Victoria is a wise and kind individual who soon finds a way of injecting a zest for life into the girl. But then, quite unexpectedly, Maksim starts to fall in love with Victoria. Suddenly he realises that, for all this time, his life has been going in the wrong direction and that he has always been surrounded by the wrong people and busy doing the wrong things. So Maksim makes a life-changing decision to drop everything to win the heart of the woman he really loves.",
