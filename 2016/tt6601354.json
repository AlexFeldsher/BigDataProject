Spectacular aerial images of this unique part of Europe show scenic bays, breath-taking mountains, wild river deltas, picturesque villages and monasteries. The landscapes we see are allowed to breathe and tell their stories. Everyday stories of the people on the ground, who live and work here, create a balance to the bird's eye view and invite the audience to experience the most authentic of Greek culture. Fishermen, monks, sculptors - ordinary people living in exceptional places - give original insights into historical buildings, sacred places, ancient traditions and culinary traditions, which have affected Europe for centuries.",
