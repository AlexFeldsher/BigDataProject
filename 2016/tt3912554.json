Dorian Spiros represents one of the biggest issues the city has faced in the last few months: his tenure with the department. As much as a few city groups have criticized the city for keeping him on the payroll, Spiros has proven over and over his capability to give more than what he takes... until now. A group of very organized thieves has been creating havoc around the city, robbing drug dealers and corrupt politicians of their hard earned money, then distributing the money among charitable organizations and people in need. This has earned them the simple name of \"The Hoods\", mainly due to their leader, Vincent Hood, a man with no past, no records: virtually no reliable means to learn anything about him anywhere in the world. Counting Vincent, this group is comprised of 5 members: Vincent's best friend, Brad \"the Pit\" O'Malley, Ex Navy Seal with a knack for spitting pits as a weapon (When not using his other skills to inflict pain... apologize later). Ex-CIA operative, Chloe Newman. She's the computer geek for Vincent's team of thieves, however, just as dangerous with her hands or weapons as any of the others. Serena Cox (Formerly Sean Cox) former Special Forces Operative and professional wrestler, although she does impromptu wrestling appearances at wrestling events, leaving before the police arrive. Vincent and his group made a point from the start to let the public know their true identities, nevertheless, the police haven't had any luck apprehending them. Spiros has been put in charge of the investigation, as The Hoods have robbed the police evidence room of over 5K dollars of seized drug money, later dropping it all at the departments doorsteps and taking it back 2 days later and distributing it to churches and other charitable organizations and people in need. They simply taunt the police at every chance they get. Spiros is just about to find out his problems are about to increase ten fold. Back in 2000, he was loaned to the Greek Hellenic Police, to assist in the investigation and apprehension of mafia mercenary bomber Themistoklis Papamalis. Themistoklis was killed during his attempted capture. His love child, Vasso Stavropoulo, is now back in the USA, seeking revenge against Spiros and the U.S. government. Vasso was given her father's fortune and will stop at nothing to inflict pain on Spiros and the U.S. government. Will Spiros accept Vincent's offer to help? Is there more to the situation than meets the eye? Oh, in case you are wondering, I'm an investigative reporter, my name is Bronson Rafferty, and I'm the Fifth and secret member of Vincent's team.",
