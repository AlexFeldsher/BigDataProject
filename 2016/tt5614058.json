But when Mo steals a cat from the funeral home's front lawn for an audition, the two start on an awkwardly loving path toward friendship. With the family-owned Eternal Dream Funeral Home as backdrop, Mia and Mo encourage one another to face the parts of life that scare them. Mia starts questioning why she lets people walk all over her, while Mo haltingly accepts the funeral home into her social life. Along the way, the two deal with Mia's overbearing boss Ms. Annvernette, Mo's egotistical acting teacher, the odd, sweet employees at the funeral home, and the unforgiving yet exciting world of Hollywood.",
