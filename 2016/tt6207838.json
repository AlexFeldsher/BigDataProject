In the series, the cast of friends and extended family is just as crazy as Lony'e & Peyton, as they navigate their own issues and relationships while playing parodies of themselves. Funny Married Stuff was created to inspire those looking to get married and to remind married couples that although marriage is hard, it's worth figuring out.",
