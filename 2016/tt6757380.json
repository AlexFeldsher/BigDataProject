Since once of the rules of the Haven is that carnivores are banned, many of the animals in the Haven - including Peepenstock, a rooster and the Founder of the Haven with a longstanding grudge against weasels - hate him. Thus, when he's framed by a gang of bullies, the citizens leap at the chance to punish him and he gets exiled into the forest. The musical follows the story of his journey in the forest, guided by manipulative forest weasel Prima, and the effects of his absence inside the Haven.",
