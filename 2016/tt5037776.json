        "plot outline": "A comedy about a group of new doctors struggle to survive \"intern hell\" at a Portland, OR hospital. After raising a family and going through a messy, well-publicized divorce, Dunthorpe socialite Camila Chivari (Marina Sirtis) returned to medical school to finally pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a doctor. On her first day on the job as a fifty-year-old, first-year intern, Dr. Chivari meets her new boss, Dr. Nate, (Joey Adams) a pop culture fanboy who's obsessed with TV reruns and prone to dream sequences featuring cast members from his favorite old shows. Only a few years older than Camila's own son, Nate is the newly promoted Chief Intern who's been taken under the wing of the brilliant and ultra-cool Medical Director, Dr. Owen Sieber (Richard Ruccolo). Except for daily abuse from his work enemy, the tough as nails Tracey Wiggins, RN (Carla Jimenez) Nate enjoys leading misfit medics struggling to survive in the hospital's training program. But, the unexpected arrival of Andrew (Jim Beaver) inadvertently reveals a dark secret which threatens to destroy Nate's future at Portland Memorial Hospital. As we mentioned, Nate is prone to imagining himself in fantasy sequences involving recreated scenes with actors from classic TV shows he grew up watching. So, each week will bring cameos from some new (old) favorites. Good times!",
