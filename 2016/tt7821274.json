Today, some 15,000 are held in federal custody and an additional 100,000 are behind bars in local jails. That sustained growth has researchers, former inmates and prison reform advocates calling for women's facilities that do more than replicate a system designed for men. A thoroughly reported piece on women's unique needs during incarceration is presented in a multimedia page experience that includes a three-part mini documentary, audio interviews, custom animated illustrations, infographics and more.",
