            "Nathaniel is a man giving the responsibility to listen to a group of people with crippling life issues and struggles to stay sober or in line. Over three months of searching, he found his ideal candidates and created a place of solace. Each week Nathaniel sits and listens to his group speak about their everyday battles. With deep and unique cases of an alcoholic tumbling down depression for the death of his wife, to a sex addict scared to be intimate with his wife. Even the strange case of Moses; a man fighting his body dysmorphia and extreme fear of confrontation. Together they will find strength in their weaknesses to build a bond destined to change their lives forever. In a drama set in the psyche of darkness, will light find a way to free them from pain?::Thomas J. Bellezza"
