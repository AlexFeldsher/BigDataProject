They do it for a variety of reasons. Like Kyle, some believe they are bound to become rich and famous, some want to move into the crew positions, some are lonely and want to meet other people, some just have it as a career. There are many reasons why people are background artists. This show follows Kyle and a group of his unconventional and diverse friends as they navigate their way through the world of background \"artistry\". The first show concentrates on their time as they become \"core\" crew on the new office comedy pilot production, \"Totally Sarah\". You'll meet Roland, the seasoned and bitter middle-age grumbler who always has a come-back and a hatred for anything crew or actor related. Gala is a stunning somewhat overconfident model type who is always getting \"featured\" roles and special benefits. Then there is the anxious Wesley, who seems to always get overlooked and left in \"extras holding\" even though he's always ready and prepared to get out on set. Anna is the logical and somewhat normal one, an average lady who is intrigued by the entertainment business and has time to do this while her husband works. She tries to keep everyone in line. There is also an array of colorful characters that you'll meet in this intriguing, unusual, and sometimes dark industry. Follow these five as they traverse the strange world of background acting with all of the unique characters and strange situations.",
