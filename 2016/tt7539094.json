This docufiction is enriched with gorgeous images of Medieval Sacred Art from the Swedish History Museum of Stockholm, which escaped the Protestant iconoclasm.

Bridget's mysticism and the core of her calling to be a bearer of divine messages for humanity are explored and enlightened in the interviews to Alessandra Bartolomei, professor in Medieval women mystics at the Gregorian University, and to prof.
