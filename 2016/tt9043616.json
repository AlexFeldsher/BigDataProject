But that doesn't mean she stays out of the kitchen. For Anjum, food is always at the heart of any holiday experience. So while she explores the picturesque Australian countryside and samples the beautiful local produce, she might just show the locals a thing or two about modern Indian cuisine. Australia holds a special part in Anjum's heart (having come here for her honeymoon), right next to her passion for food. From produce to local delicacies and beautiful landscapes, Anjum explores the wonders of modern Indian cuisine, showcasing how healthy, fresh and easy Indian flavours can be.",
