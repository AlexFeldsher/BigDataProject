SLEEP TIGHT is a horror anthology that follows a young woman determined to document the first hand accounts of people who have survived unimaginable horrors that range from the real to the supernatural. The deeper she gets in collecting the stories of these survivors the more she is confronted by the memory of her own nightmare that she cannot escape."
