Filmed entirely in one 24-hour period, thousands of filmmakers capture joys and struggles, begging the question: What is the future of the American city? An investigation, prompted by 10 questions, brings together voices of experts and everyday people. From city mayors to homeless citizens, learn from a unique community investigation. Framing the city as a center for innovation and humanity, the series begins by examining why we live in metropolises in the first place. What is it that drives us to build and live in complex societies? The city, described as an organism, lives and breaths with culture and opportunity. Many challenges that face metro areas are also easily seen, while still, some are in the shadows. The show offers unique local access to citizens that are on the edge. Some of the individual stories and experiences shared link deeper into bigger issues and insecurities that face us all. Gentrification, homelessness, violent crime, climate change - can a total collapse of the system actually happen? The story of the American city does have plenty of hope. And, through the lens of a diverse community of filmmakers, solutions and collective action are celebrated. From reformed prison inmates, to urban farmers, to MIT technologist, it is clear that fresh thinking, strong leadership and a true commitment to the future will ensure that the story of the American city is full of opportunity and fulfilled dreams.",
