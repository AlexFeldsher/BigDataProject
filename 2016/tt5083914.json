They (overzealously) seize every opportunity they can to explore new avenues in their social and love lives. Each episode of \"Us Too\" will cover situations that our heroes get themselves into as well as how they (attempt to) get themselves out, usually to hilarious and often painfully awkward effect. Ultimately, Dean and Randy are good guys, but despite their best efforts and intentions, their attempts to connect with others and grow into the guys they want to be inevitably lands them flat on their faces."
