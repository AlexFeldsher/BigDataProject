Celery, Jet's mom, takes them on a tour of the solar system and introduces each of the eight planets. \"Jet Cooks Dinner\"- Sydney, Mindy, Sunspot, and Sean help Jet cook a classic meal from Bortron 7 for his parents, Celery and Carrot. After some funny attempts, the kids find that using the Scientific Method works best to get the meal done in time.",
            "\"Just the Right Distance From the Sun\"- Sean explains to the others that Earth is a \"Goldilocks\" planet because it's not too hot and not too cold. When Celery takes the kids to space, they observe how the other planets don't have the right attributes to support life, but Earth is \"just right\"! \"Solar Power Rover\"- Jet, Sean, and Sydney visit their Mars Robot Rover friend at the DSA, and discover that the rover seems tired. Through helping the solar powered robot regain its energy, they learn how energy can be captured, used from the Sun, and used anywhere - even on Mars.",
            "\"Round and Round\"- The kids learn how all the planets both orbit around the Sun and rotate on their own axes at the same time. \"The Plant From Bortron 7\"- Jet attempts to grow a seed from his home planet, but the light from our Sun is stronger than the light from Bortron 7, and has a surprising effect on the plant!",
            "\"Mission to the Moon\"- Sean tells Jet, Sydney, and Mindy about the Apollo 11 mission, and the kids decide to do a real-life reenactment of man's first mission landing on the Moon! \"Mindy's Moon Bounce House\"- Jet gives a special birthday gift to Mindy that allows her to defy gravity. She has so much fun hovering above everyone, the others have to convince her to come back to Earth for her party."
