Ramses Wesley, along with his wife, Marguerite Arnaud Wesley and their fellow conspirator, Scott Gaines, operate a church out of a storefront called the Duffy Street Church. They start the church as a way to skim monies by taking advantage of the 501c3 tax exempt status. Unfortunately, with Ramses as Lead Pastor, the church fails to net the monetary proceeds they all envisioned. Because of this, Marguerite and Scott both become disillusioned with Ramses - however, for vastly different reasons. Scott, thanks to his wife, Valera, begins to believe in \"The Word\", while Marguerite dreams of the day when reluctant oldest child, Richard Walter Wesley, comes to his senses and takes over the church. Unlike Ramses, Richard has been blessed with the innate ability to lead. Richard ultimately comes around and willingly allows himself to start being groomed as Ramses' successor. The transition does not go smoothly and creates more friction in the already fragile father-son relationship. Undaunted, and with Richard soon to be upfront, Marguerite embarks on her grand plan to take the Duffy Street Church from a storefront to a mega-church. Marguerite will stop at nothing - nor will she allow anyone - to get in the way of her achieving this goal.",
