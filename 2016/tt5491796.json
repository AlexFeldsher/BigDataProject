            "Young, naïve Billy is new to L.A. This Texan cowboy dreams of stardom and left the rodeo circuit to try his luck in Hollywood. He was not aware of the financial implications of his move and ends up spending his first night in town sleeping on a bench. A man approaches him the following morning and offers him inexpensive lodging in a modest home shared by nearly 20 people, all of them entertainment industry hopefuls. One of his housemates, a pretty girl, mentions she is going on an audition and asks Billy to join her, since there might be a role for him as well. However, the type of acting job the cowboy is offered is not quite what he had in mind.\n"
