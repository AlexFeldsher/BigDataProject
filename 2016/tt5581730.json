From the world's greatest leapers, to its most innovative gliders and ultimately animals that effortlessly stay airborne for hours without flapping a wing - each of the incredible creatures we'll meet has its own special techniques. But to take to the air they must all overcome one of the planet's most powerful and universal forces - gravity.    "

All these record breakers push physics and physiology to the limit, but although each one employs a different aerodynamic mix of speed, maneuverability, endurance and power it allows them all, in their own unique way, to become true masters of the sky.
