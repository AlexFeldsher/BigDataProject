Now she works in real estate, she is successful, smart, good-looking, she has an amazing career, and she is willing to take on any kind of challenge. She was always surrounded by male attention. But Lena is a career-oriented woman, not that keen on her personal life. Fleeting romances lost their appeal - So there is no man by her side, but not that it matters all that much. The work life is so involving, it leaves no room for the personal. A bolt from the blue hits her when doctors find out she has a long-term health issue that would leave her unable to have kids soon. And she's almost 40. She makes a decision to get pregnant and have kids. ASAP. Lena never dealt with a \"challenge\" like that, so it threw her off a bit. Gotta do what you gotta do. Lena takes on this new challenge in her natural \"can-do-it\" manner, and she doesn't even see it as that big of a deal. However, finding a perfect man to be a father of her child turns out to be not that easy. All the men she had around for all the various reasons turn out to be a poor fit for the father role, never mind being a husband. Some are already married, others are terrified by the idea of being a father and having that responsibility, and someone turns out to be just a womanizer and scoundrel. Should we even bother saying that at the end of our story Yelena realizes that love is more important than any career, and that only the two people who are really in love can have a desirable baby? The real love won't keep you waiting for long, and it would happen where you least expect it.",
