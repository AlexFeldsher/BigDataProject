            "Craft beer as reality TV is an idea aligned with the explosion of interest in craft beer and the increasing number of breweries nationwide. Its been tried before most notably by Discovery Channel with Brew Masters, the 2010 show in cooperation with Dogfish Head Brewing. It was canceled after one season, thanks to both low ratings and reported pressure from a large beer company who threatened to pull advertising from Discovery.So its with interest that we viewed the premiere of Esquire Networks new Brew Dogs. In the three years since 2010, craft beer has gone mainstream-ish. The shows stars, Scotsmen James Watt and Martin Dickie, bring an evangelists sensibility to their celebration of craft beerpart of their hope is to convert craft beer virgins.Each episodes premise is seemingly simple: Visit a town with a thriving craft beer scene, Anthony Bourdain-style and brew a crazy beer celebrating that scene. What makes the show work are the charming antics of Watt and Dickie, whose Scottish brewery BrewDog is known for a rather extreme approach to beer and an in-your-face punk ethos. The show intersperses educational elements with spontaneous attempts by the brewdogs to convert unsuspecting targets into craft beer loversyou see them approaching middle-aged ladies, residents of a senior citizens home and random folks in a train station."
