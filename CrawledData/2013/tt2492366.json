Especially if you have a taste for the unexpected... Camp Lakebottom follows the adventures of 12-year-old prankster McGee and his summer at the most dangerous and exciting summer camp in the world. The cabins are run down, the lake is toxic, the forest creatures are mutants and the counselors are a freak show, but McGee and his friends Gretchen and Squirt are having the time of their lives. The only thing they could do without is that snooty kid, Jordan Buttsquat, from the squeaky clean rival camp across the lake, Camp Sunny Smiles."
