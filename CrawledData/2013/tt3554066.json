            "When Diva makes her entrance, the whole room stops to look, waiting with baited and uncertain breath for what she may say or do next. Whether she is sitting under the dryer at the salon, enjoying a meal at a fancy steak house or bowling for strikes at the local alley, Diva's natural wit and unique take on life engages, entertains and frequently mystifies friends and strangers alike. Based in part on the true-life adventures of singer, actress and one-time Hollywood stunt woman Marneen Fields, Diva brings an hilarious and truly one-of-a-kind perspective to the cult of celebrity.::John Harrison"
