            "The political landscape of S.E. Asia was drastically changed in 1964 as MI-6, CIA and a host of rival gangs and factions tore apart Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos etc. plunging them further into the war which officially started in 1955 but did not \"heat up\" until the mid to late '60s. Rebel, Sam Callahan, is Australian by birth; with his mother he was interned at Changi by the Japanese during WWII. Sam is deeply ingrained in all facets of Singapore society. His dead boss, detective Winston Cheng, leaves a widow, Patricia, who is intent on finding her husband's killer. With the help of Su Ling, Patricia's niece, Kang, Sam's Asian business partner, a journalist named Bruce \"Macca\" MacDonald and a ragtag string of sometimes associates, they run the Cheng Detective Agency and mix into and resolve cases of both international and global importance.::LA-Lawyer"
