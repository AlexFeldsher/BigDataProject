            "Excellent story of a Yak Fighter Squadron fighting in Soviet Union.Very insightful character stories complemented by realistic aviation combat scenes.The Cast are well known at home and give a very good quality to this presentation! Well worth coping with the sub titles to see another side of the Second World War,in which the Soviet Union lost so many to throw back the Fascists.::peterkeane182"
