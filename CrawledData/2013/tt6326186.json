Gao Deng and Lin Feng gradually become good friends. In order to ensure the safety of lives and property of the people living in the frontier, the army organizes a mine-clearance action. Therefore, Gao Deng and Lin Feng go to clear mines for the local people, making a great contribution to the eradication of mines in that area. After the action, they join the Mine-action Group for Border Demarcation, open up the boundary demarcation passage with their comrades, eradicate the minefields around the new boundary tablets and ensure the safety of personnel involved in border demarcation, thus successfully complete the significant task of erecting boundary tablets. While clearing mines, Lin Feng sacrifices his life for the children living on the border. After Lin Feng's death, Gao Deng inherits his will and becomes an excellent peacekeeping soldier through hard training and working, who composes a heroic song of the contemporary Chinese soldier with his blood and sweat.",
