Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",

            "2000 years from now, humans are nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.::Anonymous",
            "Set in a fantasy world, mankind is driven to the brink of extinction by mindless, man-eating giants known as Titans. In defense, all of humanity retreated to a civilisation contained within three concentric 50-meter Walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina. In the year 845, after nearly a century of relative peace within the walls, a 60-meter \"Colossal\" Titan materialised at and destroyed the outermost gate, ushering in hoards of smaller Titans. Witnessing the fullness of the Titan horror first-hand, a young and tenacious Eren Jaeger vows to rid the world of all Titans and win back freedom for mankind. He is joined by his adoptive sister, Mikasa Ackerman and their friend, Armin Arlert as they set out to fulfill this shared dream.::Alora McCartney",

In a last ditch attempt to live, a small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of Titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years having a century of uneasy peace. But the walls of the city cannot hold forever.::GrimFaceJoey",
            "Eren Jaeger swore to wipe out every last Titan, but in a battle for his life he wound up becoming the thing he hates most. With his new powers, he fights for humanity's freedom facing the monsters that threaten his home. After a bittersweet victory against the Female Titan, Eren finds no time to rest-a horde of Titans is approaching Wall Rose and the battle for humanity continues.::http://www.animenewsnetwork.com",
            "A threat has befallen humanity as \"Titans\" appeared out of nowhere and started devouring one person after another. In an attempt to defend and rebuild humanity humans have been forced to live in a small section of the world where three different districts were created and each district has a large wall surrounding each in hopes of preventing the \"Titans\" from coming through but hopes and attempts were futile as the \"Titans\" penetrated two of the great walls and one infiltrated the third by posing as a human.::J.
