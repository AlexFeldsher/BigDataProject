But when David throws a big Miami bash and invites all of them, the opportunity finally arises for the two main women in Ben's life to great each other face-to-face. However, not all of David's party guests are happy to see Katrina--especially since she didn't even RSVP! Meanwhile, Sunita makes an attempt at setting Katrina up on a blind date, and Patricia seals a big business deal.    "
