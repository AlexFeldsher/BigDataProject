Join them on an adventure to find out how Italians really live and really eat. Arriving by helicopter or hitching a ride on a farm vehicle, they dine in Renaissance castles, spearfish off the Sicilian coast and learn to milk buffalo. Their challenge in each episode is to prepare a homemade meal for the locals using what they've learned, tasted and stolen - all in a day! Kylie's passion for Italy made her abandon a high-paid position as a magazine editor in Australia. Her love for food led her to Patrick's cooking blog. Patrick, having already given up his law career in London to become a chef, agreed to put his trust in a complete stranger as his guide through the length and breadth of Italy - and so the adventure began...
