            "On a revolutionary battlefield Ichabod Crane meets and kills the Horseman of Death. But in doing so he is mortally wounded. In order to save his life, his wife, a witch, with the help of warlock, Reverend Knapp, link Ichabod to the horseman of death. Over 200 years later, an evil force awakens the now headless horseman. While stealing a horse from a barn, he is confronted by the sheriff of Sleepy Hollow, who is shocked to see that the shadowy figure in the barn lacks a head.Lt. Abbie Mills, of Sleepy Hollow who was with the Sheriff, but is charged with finding the owner of the farm, comes upon the owners headless body. She runs to warn the sheriff, but its too late and he too is beheaded. She realizes that the murderer is sitting on a pale horse with no head and an odd branding on his hand.Because Ichabod is linked to the horseman, he also awakes. The shock of going from 1781 to 2013 brings him to the notice of police officer Andy Brooks, who takes him into custody for the murder of sheriff Corbin. He tries to explain who he is, but that lands him in a psych ward. While digging into the sheriffs secret files, Abbie realizes that Crane is telling the truth. That the horseman of war is indeed on earth and he's soon to be joined by the horseman of famine, war and conquest. And that it is their job to stop this from happening."
