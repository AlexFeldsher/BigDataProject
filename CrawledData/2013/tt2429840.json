            "_Seed_ (qv) is a single-camera, half-hour comedy following Harry, a likable bachelor and bartender whose previous foray into sperm donation has resulted in offspring he was unaware of - until now. This ill-equipped bachelor finds himself entangled in the lives of his newfound children and their less-than-thrilled families - a lesbian couple and their 9-year-old oddball son, an up-tight, upper-class husband and wife and their rebellious teenage daughter, and an impulsive single woman with a ticking biological clock... pregnant with his child - with whom he'll come to share more than just his DNA.::Anonymous"
