Upon moving into the castle to live with her new family including her step-father, King Roland II, and step-siblings, Amber and James, Sofia quickly discovers that looking like a princess isn't all that difficult, but possessing the characteristics of a true princess - honesty, loyalty, courage, independence, compassion and grace - is what makes one truly royal.
