        "plot outline": "Taylor has an unusual hobby: She spends every minute of her free time on the back of one of her nine horses and trains for several rodeo events. Almost every weekend, the 11th-Grader and her family are on the road to take part of rodeo competitions in her home province of British Columbia, Canada. She is especially excited about this year's High School Rodeo finals, as it is the last time she can compete together with her brother Logan, who will be finishing 12th Grade this year. Even though her favorite horse is injured, Taylor hopes they will perform well. However, she cannot lose track of her academic activities, as good notes are a requirement for all athletes to compete.
