        "plot outline": "\"A brunch between three couples takes a dark turn when an uninvited guest interrupts the festivities -- and is soon found murdered.\" Unlike traditional films, TV shows or web series, the viewers of \"Untitled Murder Project 2.0\" can choose their preferred order for watching the episodes, which are organized into 5 chapters and divided into 3 parallel time-lines (Right Now, Hours Ago and Weeks Ago). By using a menu that appears at the end of each episode, viewers can choose their own path towards finding out who the killer is. \"Untitled Murder Project 2.0\" is the follow-up to 2011's \"Untitled Fiction Project\", an hour-long experiment in unscripted fiction filmmaking about the aftermath of an affair. Like its predecessor, \"Untitled Murder Project 2.0\" was shot using structured improvisation, with dialogue developed by the actors and the director on the day of the shoot based solely on an outline. The 13 original episodes of \"Untitled Fiction Project\" comprise Chapter 1 of \"Untitled Murder Project 2.0\".",

            "\"A brunch between three couples takes a dark turn when an uninvited guest interrupts the festivities -- and is soon found murdered.\" Unlike traditional films, TV shows or web series, the viewers of \"_Untitled Murder Project 2.0_ (qv)\" can choose their preferred order for watching the episodes, which are organized into 5 chapters and divided into 3 parallel time-lines (Right Now, Hours Ago and Weeks Ago). By using a menu that appears at the end of each episode, viewers can choose their own path towards finding out who the killer is. \"_Untitled Murder Project 2.0_ (qv)\" is the follow-up to 2011's \"Untitled Fiction Project\", an hour-long experiment in unscripted fiction filmmaking about the aftermath of an affair. Like its predecessor, \"_Untitled Murder Project 2.0_ (qv)\" was shot using structured improvisation, with dialogue developed by the actors and the director on the day of the shoot based solely on an outline. The 13 original episodes of \"Untitled Fiction Project\" comprise Chapter 1 of \"_Untitled Murder Project 2.0_ (qv)\".::Alonso Mayo"
