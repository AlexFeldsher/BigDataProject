The audience is given a choice to join the fight and take a side Guardians or Uricks who will save the earth, or destroy it. You will see the audience incorporated throughout the film as mustachioed aliens or in video vignettes where mustaches are being removed to stun the Uricks. Earth's greatest threat is hiding right underneath our noses!"
