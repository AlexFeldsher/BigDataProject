The film will also expose the dog and cat fur trade, a largely unknown animal protection issue, and bring it into the international spotlight. This spiritually evocative film speaks from the soul perspective and is a calling for transformational social evolution of our planet. The film's message will awaken the conscience of humanity, bring to light the consequential effect of an egocentric society, intuitively evolve the collective consciousness toward fundamental and sustainable change, and engender compassion, empathy and peace on our planet.",
