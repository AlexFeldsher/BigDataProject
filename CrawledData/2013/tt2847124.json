However, Ooka together with his friend, the Western medicine doctor Sakakibara Iori, take measures to make him admit the crime and let him go. Several years later, in 1716, Yoshimune becomes the eighth Tokugawa shogun. The following year, Ooka is relieved of his post of magistrate and ordered to return to Edo with haste. Back in 1712, Ooka had convicted Yoshimune of poaching at Ise's Akogigaura, a place where hunting and fishing are prohibited, and arrested him. It has been a long while since Ooka visited Edo.

Other than administrating the the town of Edo, Ooka also has a seat on the judicial council, manages local government affairs as well as temples and shrines.
