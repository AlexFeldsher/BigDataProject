After witnessing a woman's suicide, Sarah assumes the stranger's identity - who happens to look just like her. Expecting to solve all her problems by cleaning out the dead woman's savings, Sarah is instead thrust headlong into a kaleidoscopic mystery as she realizes the dizzying truth - she and the dead woman are clones. As Sarah searches for answers, she discovers the chilling fact that there are more people like her out there - genetically identical individuals who were planted in unsuspecting birth parents and nurtured in completely different circumstances. With no idea who created the clones, she'll need to discover the reason in a hurry as an assassin is killing them one by one.",

            "SPOILER: _Orphan Black_ (qv) follows outsider, orphan and street-wise chameleon Sarah. After witnessing a woman's suicide, Sarah assumes the stranger's identity - who happens to look just like her. Expecting to solve all her problems by cleaning out the dead woman's savings, Sarah is instead thrust headlong into a kaleidoscopic mystery as she realizes the dizzying truth - she and the dead woman are clones. As Sarah searches for answers, she discovers the chilling fact that there are more people like her out there - genetically identical individuals who were planted in unsuspecting birth parents and nurtured in completely different circumstances. With no idea who created the clones, she'll need to discover the reason in a hurry as an assassin is killing them one by one.::Annonymous",
            "A woman, Sarah Manning, spots her doppelganger on a station platform. The double then commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Sensing an opportunity, Manning takes on the deceased woman's identity. However, she soon discovers that the doppelganger is not just a once-off and the more she investigates this strange occurrence, the more dangerous it gets.....::grantss",
            "Sarah Manning, a streetwise Brit by upbringing, has had a difficult life, living in foster care with a flamboyantly gay foster brother, artist Felix Dawkins, both under the care of their equally tough foster mother Siobhan Sadler, who eventually moved them all to Toronto. All single Sarah really wants is to provide a comfortable and stable life for her adolescent daughter, Kira. Sarah's life changes in an instant when she witnesses a woman who looks exactly like her commit suicide by stepping in front of a train. Witnessing that event is the first step to Sarah discovering that she was and is part of a cloning project, two of her other \"sisters\", suburban soccer mom Alison Hendrix and Ph.D. microbiology candidate Cosima Niehaus, along with her who collectively try to uncover the nature of the project, including who may be constantly watching them, and if there are other sisters out there about which they do not know. They will find that not all of their sisters would work toward the same goals as them, and that a parallel project has a completely different set of identicals.::Huggo"
