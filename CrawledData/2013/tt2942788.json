Sadly, our \"small town boy with a big heart\" is having troubles adjusting to single life in Vancouver. Troy is the window into the series, and introduces viewers to the rest of the colorful and lovelorn cast: Michael (Michael Goudge), Troy's best friend and stereotypical laid back yoga-performing West Coast guy; Sheri (Sheri Rabold), the sexy, smart, sassy busybody of the group; and of course, what would a Vancouver TV series be without a single dad and up-and-coming Vancouver real estate agent, in the form of \"Chadillac\" Chad Mayweather (Chad Riley). This ensemble cast brings wacky-yet-heartfelt stories to life that we can all associate with, and adds a Vancouver twist. Other cities have had their fair share of love stories; now it's Vancouver's time to shine.::Troy Mundle"
