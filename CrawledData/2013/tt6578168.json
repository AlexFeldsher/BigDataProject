            "From the mountains to the marshes and all points in between, hosts Chris Dorsey and Gerald McRaney enjoy first class hunting and fishing adventure in _Ram Outdoorsman_ (qv). It's about overcoming challenges, hunting harder than ever, and uncovering the greatest rewards the sport has to offer. Along the way we'll learn that the success of a hunter is really about what he gives back to the sport, what he takes from the field. It's about living in the moment of a hunt, dreaming about future adventures, and honoring those who came before us to create this uniquely American outdoor culture and spirit. _Ram Outdoorsman_ (qv) drives to new heights in outdoor adventure television.::Outdoor Channel"
