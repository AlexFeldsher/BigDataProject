It is a regular program on TVTokyo (Chanel 7) on Monday evenings. In the program, a team of interviewers go around various airports in Japan, with Narita International Airport as their main reporting hub, and ask non-Japanese arrivals \"Why did you come to Japan?\". They then attempt to follow the interviewees on their respective journeys around Japan. Each individual has their own unique reason for coming to Japan, and each episode can therefore contain fun, serious, or unusual stories of why Japan is important to the people interviewed. Many foreign celebrities from different industries have appeared on the show, including Bob Sapp (wrestler), Benedict Cumberbatch (actor), Leron Lee (baseball player), and more.",
