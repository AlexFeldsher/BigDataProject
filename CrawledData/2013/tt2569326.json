            "The Australian version of the British series where ten contestants have to bake three treats each week within a particular style of baking or theme. The first bake is the Signature Bake, something within the theme that the baker considers special, which says something about the baker as an individual. The second bake is the Technical Bake, where all of the bakers are given the same recipe and ingredients, but some parts of the method are missing. This bake is designed as a test of how much knowledge the bakers have about their craft, and is the only one to have a blind judging, where the judges rank the bakes from best to worst without knowing which baker baked which treat. The final bake is the Showstopper, which is the ultimate test of creativity, skill and ambition, designed to take the bakers' baking to the next level, which is as much about the Wow factor as deliciousness. After the bakes, the judges decide on the best and worst bakers, with the best baker being crowned the \"Star Baker\", and the worst being eliminated. The competition is held over eight weeks, with three contestants competing in the final from which one will be crowned as the winner. That baker will receive a dream kitchen bake-over makeover from Harvey Norman, and a five day baker's retreat at the Byron At Byron.::Allister Coots"
