            "The show offers a view behind the curtains of the people who inhabit the strange, small worlds in the country that won the European Championship in football... back in 1992. A fact that the country and its inhabitants still remember vividly - it doesn't matter that this event now took place over 20 years ago. These are the stories of the ambitious handball coach who is never satisfied with his girls team whenever they are losing, the mum and dad who never agree on anything, Pia who is at the gynecologist for an examination, the business coach who is teaching the employees at the cardboard box factory about corporate identity and many, many more strange, often painfully awkward and surprising characters."
