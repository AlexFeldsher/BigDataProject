            "Carter, Sid, and Teddy are childhood friends from New York. After moving to LA, the trio get into the world of narcotics thanks to the brilliant mind of Carter, who cuts and creates a form of cocaine that is far more potent than anything on the market. Carter also suffers from a rare condition known as Ataraxia, in which he is freed from worry or preoccupation. Because of this condition, though, Carter has the uncanny ability to think perceptively, understanding almost any angle in any situation. When Kait, Carter's girlfriend and Sid's sister, becomes a victim of a deadly assault by a drug syndicate, the two friends look to take vengeance. Yet nothing is what it seems when a drug deal goes terribly wrong, and the three friends must breakdown the events of a single day to find the truth behind the chaos."
