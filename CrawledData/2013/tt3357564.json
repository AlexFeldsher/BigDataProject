As he starts getting drawn to the life of faith by a rabbi, he tries to persuade Alma, who has become his new girlfriend, to also consider it. After setting this stage, the TV series explores Alma's skepticism about the religious life, her interactions with those who practice it, and whether the couple should remain secular, pursue a life of faith together, or break up. Several people tug her in different directions: her boyfriend, a Jewish man who lost his faith, the rabbi, his enthusiastic followers, and her skeptical parents.
