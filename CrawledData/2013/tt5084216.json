            "The Drunk Series is a hilarious experiment in writing screenplays while drunk with several writers from the Portland, OR area. It was promised that whatever was written, they would be produced as high-quality short films. Six scripts were born out of inebriation, and brave and talented cast members were asked to be sloppy, near-blackout drunk on the days and nights of filming (many had to even audition drunk). Strangely enough, it can take awhile to make films even halfway watchable with a bunch of drunkards. But for the love of comedy and a little liver damage, these are the wacky results."
