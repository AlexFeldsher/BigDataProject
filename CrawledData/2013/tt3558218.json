            "Totally fictional mini-series set in late 1941 when the Nazi forces are at the outskirts of Moscow only to find themselves thwarted by the Soviet soldiers and an early winter. To compliment the invasion the Reich seeks to kill Joseph Stalin in the hope of striking a shattering blow to the Soviet people. This operation is the mission of a special forces unit of Abwehr officers and aided by a Nazi agent planted within the Soviet Army. But brave and resourceful officers of the USSR's Ministry of State Security stand in their way. A decent period piece that has little historical context and is basically a good detective show."
