            "Breathless, two parts Beau Gest, one part Mad Men plus maybe a pinch of heart beat. This quintessential English tale is here, retold in the guise of the sixties. Whereas the original story features the French foreign legion that same path run deep through this series. Not by any means original or perfect. Jack Davenport shines perhaps out of all the performers. Transforming his much earlier sitcom days in serious tongue in cheek acting. One can't help but think that \"Jane\" will start playing and women will lose their in the door of a Gestapo vehicle. Part psycho drama, sixties soap and tragic comedy. I'd give this 8 our of 10 as it's great, but far from perfect."
