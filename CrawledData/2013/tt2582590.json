            "In London, Freddie Thornhill and Stuart Bixby are an aged gay couple who have been partnered for half a century, with Freddie the breadwinner as a struggling actor whose fame is less than he wants to believe, and Stuart the slavish househusband. Their partnership is deep in the closet to Stuart's elderly mother, who still believes her son will someday marry a nice girl and to who Stuart still speaks on the telephone every morning. Familiarity has bred outward contempt as Freddie and Stuart are constantly bickering with each other, throwing verbal barbs at each other. That familiarity and contempt also extend to their longtime and closest similarly aged friends: wannabe cougar Violet, forgetful Penelope, and always ignored Mason. But this outward behavior masks true love and affection. Their collective lives are given a burst of energy when Ash Weston, a naive, poor and good-looking young man, moves into the small studio apartment above Freddie and Stuart's. About Ash, Freddie and Stuart initially ponder \"is he or isn't he (gay)\", hoping that he bats for the same team as them, Violet hoping the opposite.::Huggo"
