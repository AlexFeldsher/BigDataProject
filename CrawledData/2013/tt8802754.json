            "\"Aise Jalay Jiya\" is a story about a selfish woman name Aman (played by Samina Ahmad). She always sacrifices the happiness of her children for her desire. Aman has one daughter (Noreen) and one son (Danish) who have married. Aman's son in law (Hamid) wishes to work in a foreign country but he doesn't have the requisite money for traveling to abroad. Then he forces his wife (Noreen) for money to go abroad but when she asks her mother (Aman) for it. She puts in stake the happiness of her son by playing with the lives of her daughter in law (Gana). Two questions arrive; Is Aman saves the marriage of her daughter? And what happens to her family? To find out, watch \"Aise Jalay Jiya\" on HUM Classics. Sumbhal is a decent girl, whose husband (Sarwat) died in an accident. Danish (played by Imran Aslam) is an evil man who always listens to her mother, including beating your wife. Aman (played by Samina Ahmad) is a materialistic woman who sacrifices the happiness of her children for her own desire. Naazreen (played by Kaif Ghazvani) is smart and intelligent young woman who is also married to Danish (played by Imran Aslam).\nShe always fights for the rights of women and helped Sumbhal into dealing with people like Aman and Danish.
