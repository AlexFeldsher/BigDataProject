In the first episode, islanders involved in the rescue on Giglio also recount a moment-by-moment narrative from their unique perspective. The second episode then provides an in depth description of advanced search and rescue missions and focuses on the technology and engineering behind the biggest salvage operation in history. The mini-series also addresses the wider reaching impact for the cruise industry and asks the hard questions that the families involved have been pushing to have answered during their long fight for justice.",
