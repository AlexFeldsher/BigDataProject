            "\nRest in Peace is a 12-episode drama series uncovering the dark secrets from the past through the interesting stories of ordinary people. Lucija Car, a young journalist, together with Martin Strugar, a retired prison guard, embarks on a journey of discovery that leads her and Martin to the hidden truths about past events. They are opposed by all those who want to keep these secrets buried deeply underground. Rest in Peace deals with dangerous secrets of the former communist regime and major social issues from Croatias recent history that have plagued all transitional countries. Lucija and Martin unearth a web of secrets from privatisation, pyramid schemes, financial meltdown, unemployment and other transitional problems to nationalism, ethnic hatred, underage prostitution - problems nobody dears to mention. However, in the first place RiP is a series that deals with human destinies, stories of ordinary people surrounded by historical events and changes. The series deals with these issues through the prism of complex human relations and individual stories and tragedies.The story begins when Lucija Car, a young and ambitious TV reporter, does an item on an unusually quick demolition of Vukovscak, countrys oldest prison. She voices suspicions about a possible murky background to such hasty actions and points to the issue of the existing prison graveyard that nobody wants to claim responsibility for. Her report stirs memories in Martin Strugar, a retired prison guard who lives on his own after the death of his wife and daughters. Lucijas editor is unhappy with the report and suspends her for a month. Although suspended, Lucija returns to Vukovscak to continue with her invesigation. Discovery of an empty grave leads her to Martin whom she asks to join the investigation. After receiving a threatening text message from an unknown number, she and Martin begin to put together a mosaic of stories buried in the prisoners graves.Their efforts are assisted, from a far, by Lucijas friend from university, Zeljko Ban, now a spokesperson for the citys police department. From one episode to another Martin and Lucija investigate individual graves, weaving together a complex narrative of different prison tales. As Lucija enters deeper into the dark world of the prison guard Martin Strugar, her interest in daily politics and journalistic sensationalism wanes. Moreover, after excavating a story about a former secret service executioner who worked for both past and present regimes, her and Martins lifes are in danger. However, Lucijas biggest shocks will come after discovering that her love interest, a popular local politican, is deeply connected to the mysteries of Vukovaks graveyard and that her partner, Martin, hides dark secrets too..."
