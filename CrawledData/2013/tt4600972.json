            "\"_En sortant de l'école_ (qv)\" is a collection of animated short films - 3 minute each - which aims at matching poems with the talent and graphic creativity of young directors, just out of French animation schools. The diversity of techniques is the keystone of this project : stop motion, rostrum camera, cutout animation, digital 2D, 3D - \"_En sortant de l'école_ (qv)\" draws on this simple idea : to give these promising directors a free pass so that they can make a name for themselves."
