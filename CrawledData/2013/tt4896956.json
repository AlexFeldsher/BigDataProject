Anglers fish for the most weight they can catch in 3 periods with live updates via tablets to the rest of the field. Each angler has an official who weighs and logs each catch and assesses any penalties. There is often a cameraman in the boat taking live action shots. All fish are caught, weighed and released at the boat. Penalties are accessed for improper handling of the fish - dropping on floor of the boat or sloppy release back into the water.",
