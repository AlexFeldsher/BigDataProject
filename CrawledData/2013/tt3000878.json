            "At first glance, Nura Rikuo seems like nothing more than a normal middle-schooler. In actual fact, he is grandson of Nurarihyon, master of a youkai clan. Having only recently resolved the hostilities between the Nura Clan and the Shikoku Yokai, Rikuo finds no rest as an ancient enemy of the Nura Clan, Haguromo-Gitsune, resurfaces. After 400 years of inactivity, Haguromo-Gitsune suddenly sweeps through Kyoto with overwhelming power.::Shakti Prasanna Mishra",
            "Rikuo Nura attends middle school by day and then comes home to a house full of \"youkai\" demons, being the grandson of Nuraihyon, who is master and leader of youkai clan, also known and feared through out all youkai. Rikuo is 1/4 part youkai (demon) which has caused some issues with a lot of the other youkai clans, one problem is Rikuo can only changes into his youkai self at night and with his grandfather nominating him to be the leader of the clan has really stirred things up. Rikuo lost hid father at a very young age, to only find out he was murdered, and now the culprit is coming for Rikuo, not to mention The Exorcist who are trying to get rid of all youkai, to say he has his hands full would be a understatement, action, comedy and more awaits the viewer.::mwg-06601"
