Taken beyond the portal by a helpful elf, and a grumpy talking stick, she is soon to discover that she is the chosen one who's coming was written, and only she can save the people of Yonderland.Two of Yonderland's characters meet as one is entering, and the other is leaving through the same door, only neither of the two will allow the other to be more courteous than he, and just as they are about to come to blows over the indignity that they each feel at having been out shined by the other the chosen one steps in out of frustration, and orders that the two of them stop fighting, and shake hands, and get over it. That day would be known as the first time in history that someone of Yonderland did not die in battle. The war was over, and all thanks to the chosen one. This new hand graspy shaking thing would replace the fighting from now on.It's parts of Princess Bride, Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, Discworld and Fraglerock + just a little \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" rolled into a nice bit of humour for all ages.*The storyline of Series 1-3, told in chronological order:Nestor of Maddox, a nobleman from the Twelve Realms, accidentally gains access to the forbidden Second Scroll that foretells the Realms' future. He is horrified to read in it that his twin daughters, one good and one evil, are destined to unite and cause unimaginable destruction. Nestor steals the scroll, kidnaps his good daughter Debbie from her wet nurse Nanny La Roo, transports himself to Earth, and leaves Debbie in the care of a public welfare agency in Birmingham, England. In this way Nestor hopes that fate will be averted and Debbie will never meet her sister.The evil daughter grows up to be Imperatrix, the ruthless warlord who conquers eleven of the Twelve Realms and is intent on subjugating the last remaining free Realm, Yonderland. An enterprising elf discovers Debbie living in Selly Oak, Birmingham, with her twin children and husband Peter, and persuades her to come with him through a convenient space-time portal in her kitchen pantry to Yonderland, where she is hailed as the Chosen One, destined to save Yonderland and usher in a new age of peace. Debbie soon finds herself on a hectic schedule shuttling back and forth between Selly Oak, where she tries to carry on her roles as wife and mother as normally as possible, and Yonderland, where she embarks on a quest to find the Second Scroll that will explain to her why she is the Chosen One. Along the way, with the help of Elf and his magic stick Nick, Debbie becomes a valued and beloved pillar of the community, offering sensible leadership and advice while dodging the attempts of Imperatrix's buffoonish sub-overlord Negatus and his demonic minions to stop her.On his deathbed, realizing that his attempts to shield Debbie from her fate have failed, Nestor sends her a box containing the Second Scroll--which one of Negatus' minions steals--and a message warning her to avoid Imperatrix. But after Imperatrix sends a giant robot to destroy Yonderland, Negatus persuades Debbie to confront Imperatrix and save the Realm. Debbie succeeds and Imperatrix disarms the robot, killing herself in the process.Peter is promoted to a new job in Glasgow, and Debbie reluctantly prepares to sell their house and lose access to her kitchen cupboard portal to Yonderland. However, a new threat to the Twelve Realms emerges: Cuddly Dick, a valued associate of the Council of Elders, whose brain has been taken over by an parasitical despot bent on conquering the Realms. The possessed Dick uses his personal warmth to seize control of the Realms, taking command of Imperatrix's crew of evil Overlords and turning the people of Yonderland against Debbie, Elf and the Elders. With Negatus as an unreliable ally, Debbie endeavors to stop Dick and win back the hearts and minds of the people of Yonderland. After a series of perilous adventures she succeeds: the parasite is removed from Dick's head, making him good again and ending his evil reign. Back on Earth, Peter realizes that neither he nor his family really wants to leave their home in Selly Oak and turns down the job in Glasgow."
