His chief client is John Bingham, Lord Lucan, ironically nicknamed Lucky due to his consistent losing streak. When Lucan's long-suffering wife Veronica protests at his profligacy he is violent and, under Aspinall's malign influence, tries - and fails - to discredit Veronica's sanity to gain custody of their children after their divorce. Whilst Veronica delights in the friendship of her nanny Sandra Rivett Lucan, once more led on by Aspinall, arrives at Veronica's house with murder in mind but, in the dark, accidentally kills Sandra, rather than intended victim Veronica. Realizing his mistake he attacks Veronica but she escapes and seeks help in a pub from where she is taken to hospital. As Lucan goes on the run Aspinall summons fellow club members and insists they close ranks to help the fugitive but the fair-minded Dominic Elwes refuses and writes an article putting Veronica's case and showing up the Clermont members for what they are. As a result he is made a social pariah and commits suicide. Meanwhile Lucan, in his absence, is found guilty of killing Sandra and attacking Veronica. In 2003 the dying Susie Maxwell-Scott summons John Pearson and tells him she believes that Aspinall got Lucan to Switzerland though she also considers that Aspinall persuaded Lucan to return to England to see his children and threw him over the side of the boat to prevent further disgrace. Veronica surmises that Lucan killed himself but both are of the opinion that his corpse lies in the English Channel.",
