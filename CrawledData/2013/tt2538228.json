Pam Johnson-Bennet's ground-breaking methods in cat training have made her the 'Queen of Cat Behaviour'. Pam has shared her knowledge in a best selling books that have won her devoted fans across America and around the world. Meet Lukey. This cat has a voracious appetite for his owner's sweaters and fights with his sister, Cali, everyday. Or how about Seamus? He's so scared of his carrier that he poops the second he's put into it. In each episode, Pam comes to the aid of worried and concerned owners of out-of-control felines. She delves into the feline mind to bring about changes in behavior that their owners could only dream of previously. Pam methods bring about huge changes within these unhappy and fur-flying households and our cameras are there to capture everything. There's a 'tough love' component for the owners too as Pam trains them to view the world not from the vantage point of a human but from the cat's level ten inches off the ground. If you needed to scratch your claws and could see only drapes and furniture, which would you use?",

            "_Psycho Kitty_ (qv), the world's #1 cat behaviorist Pam Johnson-Bennett and her co-host, Chris Duchaine, show cat owners how to do the previously unthinkable: TAME THEIR CATS! Pam Johnson-Bennet's ground-breaking methods in cat training have made her the 'Queen of Cat Behaviour'. Pam has shared her knowledge in a best selling books that have won her devoted fans across America and around the world. Meet Lukey. This cat has a voracious appetite for his owner's sweaters and fights with his sister, Cali, everyday. Or how about Seamus? He's so scared of his carrier that he poops the second he's put into it. In each episode, Pam comes to the aid of worried and concerned owners of out-of-control felines. She delves into the feline mind to bring about changes in behavior that their owners could only dream of previously. Pam methods bring about huge changes within these unhappy and fur-flying households and our cameras are there to capture everything. There's a 'tough love' component for the owners too as Pam trains them to view the world not from the vantage point of a human but from the cat's level ten inches off the ground. If you needed to scratch your claws and could see only drapes and furniture, which would you use?::Anonymous"
