        "plot outline": "Local version of the TV-format \"Copycat Singers\", originally aired in Sweden 2011. This fun format combines the glamor of performance with a touch of glorious nostalgia. Each show is built around well-known songs from one of the country's most famous singers. The five copycat singers have spent their lives imitating their idol's unique voice - now they get to stand on the same stage. Over five rounds these dedicated fans must convince 'blind' judges that they are the star. The winner is then presented with the most exhilarating challenge of all - they get to compete against their hero. Can they shine brighter than the star? Can they produce such an impeccable replica performance that the judges think they are better than the original?",
