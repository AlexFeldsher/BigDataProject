A viewer/player must answer each question correctly to remain in the game; wrong answers result in the player being eliminated from the competition for that game. An episode which starts out with hundreds of thousands of players might wind up with only a few hundred players correctly answering all 12 questions; the prize for the game (say, $5,000) is then divided equally among all of the winners.",
