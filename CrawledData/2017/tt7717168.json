            "William, Alice and Steve decide to create the web series \"Deer Alice\" to achieve the\nsuccess that would fill the void of their meaningless lives. At the start, they struggle\nto break the one-digit mark on their Youtube channel subscriptions. Also, they can'tdecide if they are doing a drama or a comedy. But after no organic success at all and\na mix of political influence with nepotism, network TV executive Silvio Piola buys the\nseries.\nWith furiously degrading reviews and ratings below zero, their first days producing\nfor TV are an all-time low. Piola should know better and jump off the Titanic of\nnetwork TV shows, but instead, he allies himself with William's mother. When that\nfails, he considers taking his own life, but then, the impossible happens: Deer Alice's\nnonsense love triangle story between two humans and a deer (played by a man\nwearing a cheap deer costume) becomes very influential among hipsters, who start a\nstrong fan base that raises Deer Alice to success. This situation brings network TV\nratings back to its days of glory.\nInstead of enjoying success, or even focusing on producing a good show, William and\nSteve begin to transpose the love triangle they created in the show into real life,\nfinding themselves both in love with Alice. William believes that the girl is in love\nwith him, and sees a chance to put an end to the endless pit of loneliness in his life.\nOn the other hand, Steve thinks he's in a serious relationship with Alice, just like\ntheir own characters in the show. Steve begins to lose track of the limitations\nbetween fiction and reality. The show is sabotaged by their childish behavior, and\nAlice has a hard time keeping the show going by herself.\nThings get a little darker when a stuntman dies while shooting an action sequence\nfor the show, and the trio abandons the spot, believing his body to have drowned in\na river. But they hadn't expected the police to look into the matter. Meanwhile, as\nthe fans move their attention from Deer Alice to a radio novella, the only solution is\nto hire an Emmy Award winning writer as the new Showrunner*. This new model of\ncollaboration doesn't go so smoothly, and with the return of an allegedly dead\nstuntman, the first season of Deer Alice gets a bloody ending.\nIn the end, Alice is arrested, Steve is institutionalized, and William flees the country\nafter running over an innocent cyclist. But then, against all odds, Deer Alice wins the\naward for Best Series at the Annual Emmy's, which plants the seed for a season 2 in\nSilvio Piola's mind."
