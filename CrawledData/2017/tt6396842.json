As they do so, viewers experience the sights and sounds of the Emerald Isle in a completely unique way, with prominent Irish actors, musicians and local characters sharing their love of home. The penniless duo charm celebrity guests such as chef Rachel Allen, Dana and Sir James Galway as well as ordinary people into joining them for novelty fundraising ideas as well as conversation. In the end, they'll cover 2,400km of the most amazing Irish countryside, meeting some great folks and visiting historic sights on their way. And if they don't raise enough money - they sleep in the car.",
