            "Have you ever wondered how a music is video is filmed? Were you ever interested in what goes into the filming process? Well, Myster DL & ILL Mannered Films have created a new web series called \"Rewind The Scenes\" where we look back at the making of some of our biggest videos. Go behind the scenes with artists like Redman, Styles P, Jadakiss & Sheek Louch of The Lox, Chuck D of Public Enemy, Sean Price and Rock (Heltah Skeltah), Termanology, Reks, Edo G, Skyzoo, Sticky Fingaz & Fredro Starr of Onyx, Cappadonna of Wu Tang Clan, Freeway, Lil Fame of M.O.P, Kool G Rap, Eric Bobo of Cypress Hill & more. This is something interesting and new for Hip Hop fans young and old. This is an on going series that began in 2017. The 1st 15 episodes were created with saved footage and narration but episode 15 and on were created with the idea for \"Rewind the Scenes\" in mind and are more in depth and often longer. The episodes premier on our website and then released on YouTube followed by our social media accounts. We decided to make this series to show people 1st hand how we make music videos and films. We have been lucky to have worked with some of the biggest artists in the hip hop genre and even so well known actors and producers. We go in depth on special effects, camera settings, lighting, angles, camera placement, set design and more. Our work has been seen on networks like HBO, ABC, CNN, BET and more. This series will be available for free on our official website along with many other projects we have done and are working on."
