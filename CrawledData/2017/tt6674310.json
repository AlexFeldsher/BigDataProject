            "KILLING RICHARD GLOSSIP follows the story of two men convicted of murder - one on death row, and the other sentenced to life without parole - who give two very different accounts of what led to the slaying of Barry Van Treese on January 7, 1997 at the Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City. Richard Glossip, a man with no prior felony convictions, has consistently maintained his innocence, insisting that he had no knowledge that anyone planned to kill Van Treese. Justin Sneed, who admitted to killing the victim and whose fingerprints were found in the room, cut a deal to receive a life sentence instead of risking the death penalty by telling the police that Glossip hired him to do it. As Glossip continues to narrowly avoid execution by the state of Oklahoma, Berlinger's cameras are embedded within his legal team in real-time as they race against the clock to uncover new evidence that proves his innocence."
