Craving being the \"cool guys\" again, Clark and Jimbo decide they need to get out on their own to have any chance at having a life. Unfortunately, due to their lack of experience, responsibility and cash, they need a third roommate in order to make this happen. Luckily for them, DONALD DOUGLAS, a nerdy classmate of theirs from high school, agrees to be the 3rd roommate. Donald isn't the ideal fit from a personality standpoint, but its slim pickens when it comes to finding guys this age who are just now looking to move out of their parent's house. Not only is his rent money green but to the surprise of Clark and Jimbo, Don also has a successful web-based dating service that he's been running from his parents' house for the past few years.",
