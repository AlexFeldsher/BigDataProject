He is a twenty-four-year-old who is handsome, witty and has great success with the ladies - which he takes as a given. Tina - is a thirty-nine-year-old who is a successful business woman and mother of three. They met under very unusual circumstances, but continued their story in the most traditional way - a date, followed by sex, followed by zero commitments. Such an arrangement satisfied them both, until Dan realizes he is madly in love. This raises a series of questions. Can Dan become a father for Tina's children? How do they deal with the grandmother - who immediately hates Dan for his young age? How will Tina's family react to such an obvious mésalliance? Finally, what will Tina do when she finds out that Dan's mother is her old school friend?",
