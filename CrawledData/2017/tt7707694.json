        "synopsis": [
            "Low Strung is a comedic series of 10 to 15-minute long webisodes that chronicle the lives of Victoria and Shervin; a small microcosm of the millennial generation. However, as the viewer becomes immersed in their storyline they may find it difficult to apply any conventional labels to the pair.Victoria and Shervin are young, black, and best friends. They have characteristics that complement each other and often move the story along in unexpected ways. Victoria's cheekiness, vulgarity, and lack of filter is juxtaposed by Shervin's extroversion and willingness to put himself out there. Together, they have interesting dialogue, and a strange unspoken mutual understanding and immense trust.At first glance, there is a typical coming-of-age tale -- despite Low Strung's propensity to satirize the tropes and cliches of the genre. Victoria and Shervin fit two-thirds the meaning of young urban professionals, and their story follows the themes in there of; dating, work, friendships, and life as a new adult.These tried and true themes take on a new meaning once thrust into the world of Victoria and Shervin, which exists mostly in the realm of reality, but occasionally dives head first into the surreal -- leaving the viewer, and the characters, equal parts shaken and amused.Shervin and Victoria experience a number of mini-adventures smattered with elements of the surreal, often blurring the lines themselves using mind-altering drugs. This lends a fresh, satirical, and often perplexing way for the viewer to vicariously experience tinder dates, pet ownership, Xboxs, exercise, sex, technology, and social media. All against the backdrop of Chicago, a city that shares characteristics with the main characters: inviting, yet frightening, beautiful, yet raw, teeming with the unexpected.Ultimately, Low Strung is an apt representation of what it means to be a part of the wayward digital generation, and what it means to experience it as a young black person. The values of Victoria and Shervin can be extrapolated to represent those of millennials as a whole: an idealistic but critical, adventurous and burgeoning generation living within a new normal; completely other than that of previous generations, molded by never-before experienced technology, connectivity, morality, and schools of thought."
