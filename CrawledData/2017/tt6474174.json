Shortly after his arrival in Taylor, Kevin discovers from his protector Yvette who no one else can see that he is the only surviving of the thirty-six righteous souls of his generation, something he cannot tell anyone. His God appointed mission under Yvette's protection is to find then anoint the replacement thirty-five, which he is to do by helping others, those specific tasks which he has to listen to the universe which will direct him. The successful completion of each task will result in a vision leading to finding the thirty-five. Kevin's problems are that he may not want to do any of these tasks either in seeming harm to himself, in his own selfishness and in seeing some of those he is directed to help as being even more selfish than him. It is made all the more difficult as some of his actions may seem more than just a little odd to his family and friends, especially to Amy who may believe that Kevin is still suffering from his suicidal tendencies. Through it all, Yvette and her colleagues still have to find out what happened to the original thirty-five and why Kevin was spared.",
