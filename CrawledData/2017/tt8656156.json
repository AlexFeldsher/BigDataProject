Starring: Tangi Miller, Vanessa Williams, Mari Morrow, Chrystee Pharris, Laila Odom and Aloma Wright. Back in the day Sophia, Robin, Lisa, and Jackie were the girls everyone wanted to be around in high school. Nearly fifteen years later nothing has changed. Whether conquering the business world, juggling men, fighting wars, or just plain looking good, nobody does it quite like this crew of self-proclaimed 'bougie babes'. But whenever you're on top, you can expect that drama and naysayers will be close by. It takes a certain kind of woman to stand tall and look good through it all.\"",
