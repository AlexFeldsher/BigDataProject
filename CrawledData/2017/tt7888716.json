Fortunately Grandpa Co has plenty of time for her. He is retired and freed from all his obligations. Together they recycle and reuse old objects. With these items of the past, Evi and Co experience playful and sometimes touching adventures of today. The five episodes show a magical world with a bit of melancholy, which gives an open goal to wonder and fantasy.",
