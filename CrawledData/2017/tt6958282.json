And to make matters worse, his girlfriend, Esther, is really \"sticking\" it to him - she wants more from their five year old relationship. Esther wants to get engaged. All of Esther's friends are either married or engaged. Some have kids. And one even owns a two bedroom unit in outer West Auckland. It's her dream. But is it Mark's dream? He's not sure - he needs time to think about it. Esther is understandably disappointed, but she wants Mark to be on the same page so she hesitantly agrees to him moving out. After an exhaustive search for a new flat, Mark meets Grant, a self-proclaimed inventor, and his nephew, Simon, an overachieving uni student. Grant and Simon are odd, but the rent is cheap. And it seems like something in the stars has brought them together. They all share the same Libran birthday. Born in 1969, 1981, and 1993, all three \"LiBros\" also fall into the Chinese Zodiac sign of the Rooster. Is it a sign? Will time with the LiBros help bring Mark the clarity he needs? Will the LiBros figure their baggage out?",
