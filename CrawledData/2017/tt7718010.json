In the first season of On The Pontoon we visited places like New York, Delaware, Wisconsin and Georgia to see all they had to offer for boaters. On The Pontoon highlights the fastest growing powerboat sales over the last 5 years. A big part of this shift in boating is comfort as pontoons are basically your living room on water. Newbies to boating or seasoned sailors are snatching these crafts up because of their spacious decks and ease of maintenance. In addition, pontoons have become much more powerful than years past due to larger and more powerful motors. It's not uncommon for models to reach up to 30-70 mph.",
