Sweeping civil rights laws have been passed. Watergate is something that hasn't yet touched the presidency, and the Cold War rages on in its quiet, persistent way, led by the the purveyors of secrecy and deception in the C.I.A., and their counterpart service, the K.G.B. This show tells the story of Timmy Sanders, now twenty-five and living in the nation's capital, working as an analyst for the C.I.A., newly married to a wonderful British woman, Zadie, who's a freelance reporter. But when Timmy's old friends Madeline Andrews and Arthur Milligan announce their engagement, Timmy is drawn back into lives he thought he had left behind years before.",
