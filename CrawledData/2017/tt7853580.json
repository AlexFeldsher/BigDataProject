Captain Belgarde takes over the case and brings in Marie Kempf, a psychiatrist who lost her own daughter, Lila, several years earlier. Belgarde investigated that case too, ruling it a suicide. Reluctant at first, Marie agrees to help on the condition that Belgarde reopen her daughter's case, which she refuses to believe was a suicide. They strike a deal and Marie takes Madeleine to her house to treat her, hoping to get the little girl to start talking and rekindle her memory.",
