No one is really listening to what the other one has to say but the interaction is still vibrant, and often high-ended. Toward the end, it's almost like if all the passengers were talking to a brick wall; but the difference is that a brick hasn't got a face or a sound. All the groups share the same conversation but never interact between and with the different groups. They only share the same train of thought(s).::Alex Altman"
