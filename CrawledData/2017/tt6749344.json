Ondi has embedded herself within a group of idealistic young students and staff members alongside a charismatic entrepreneur, who facing impending climate disaster, have committed themselves to the creation of \"the world's greatest sustainable modern town in Panama, called Kalu Yala (\"Sacred Land\". She captures the conflict and catharsis that comes when their dream of \"sacred land\" collides with the reality that they are in the middle of the jungle and must make everything they need, literally building something from nothing --from basic shelter to a functional community.
