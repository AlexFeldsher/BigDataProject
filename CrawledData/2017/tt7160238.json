However, as Seymour gets hungrier he must learn to control his urges. Strange circumstances abound as he also endeavors to keep the particulars of his new existence from his family. Seymour has to work his way out of many uncomfortable situations in his new altered life. Seymour finds some comfort after his abduction by the Agency of the Supernatural Rehabilitation Services. A world wise werewolf, named Chester, is sent to guide him through this transition. Chester is charmingly unrefined and is keen to keep an eye on the unfortunate Seymour as he knows how unaccepting humans can be to those who are different. A new threat arises when Seymour's condition is inadvertently revealed to a fairy (displaying no characteristics normally associated with being a fairy). Lark Cedarcreek, is tall and usually bears no visible wings. Far from being a gentle, nymph like creature, he bears a greater resemblance to Boris Karlof. It is revealed that while the blood of a fairy can allow a vampire to walk in the light of day, fairies are dangerous to vampires because vampire blood is like a drug to a fairy. The series is threaded with action, sarcasm and situational humor. Seymour is lovable, and naive. His friends are loyal. It is an adventure through the surprises experienced by a newly turned, fairly innocent vampire to find acceptance of himself, friends, family and survival with his new life.",
