With a history rooted in violence and mutiny, the Neddeaus and their ancestors have lived secluded on Duqesne Island for over a hundred years, speaking an arcane language, and practicing a forgotten faith. The film, released as 10 episodes, follows teenage son Elmer Neddeau, as he navigates the curiosities of puberty, the strict rules of the island upheld by his devout parents, and the sinister plots of his twin sisters -- all while he dreams of the mainland. Unearthed and remastered for digital release, The Neddeaus is the never before seen portrait of a bizarre self-exiled family and the strange rituals that make up their off-the-grid existence.",
