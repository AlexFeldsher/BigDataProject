Nile plays this song for us and we see him and Chic in concert playing it too - along with lots of their greatest hits. The film uncovers the source of inspiration for many of Nile's songs - being turned away from Studio 54 led him to write Le Freak, while others, including Lost in Music, have their roots in Nile's troubled and difficult childhood, and how he hears music all the time - a subject he speaks about candidly.

While Kathy Sledge of Sister Sledge reveals the joyous and exacting way Nile worked with them to produce their internationally successful album We Are Family and the hit single He's the Greatest Dancer. Throughout the film Nile demonstrates, in a series of short masterclasses, how he writes and develops his music.
