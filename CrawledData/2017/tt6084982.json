At first, both Akiko and Mizuki hit it off with Matsushima which leads Akiko to encourage Mizuki to date him. However, once Mizuki starts going out with Matsushima, she realizes how she had been tightly controlled by her mother all this while and attempts to break free from this unhealthy relationship between them. When Akiko realizes what is going on, she resorts to extreme measures i.e. seducing Matsushima in order to get her beloved daughter back.",
