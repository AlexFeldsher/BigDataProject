            "_Buddy Thunderstruck_ (qv) is an action-comedy, stop-motion extravaganza that follows the adventures of a semi-truck racing dog named Buddy and his albino ferret mechanic. It all goes down in race-obsessed Greasepit, a place chock full of larger-than-life characters and nitro-burning, gear-slamming, tire-squealing, fish-tailing good times.::Jermy Leeuwis",
            "In the town of Greasepit, there is no racer like _Buddy Thunderstruck_ (qv), a good-old boy racing trucker dog with a wild need for speed, and a desperate one for common sense. With his good ferret buddy, Darnell, those two spend their days tearing up the racetracks and roads to the annoyance of the Sheriff and usually getting into more trouble than they knew existed. Fortunately, with the help of Buddy's sister, Muncie, and his other friends, Buddy can usually get himself out of any predicament gets himself into.::Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)"
