        "plot outline": "Whether you want to believe it or not, the war between Heaven and Hell is real. Having fallen out of favor at the dawn of time, Joshua, the exiled Angel, stands where the borders of the two realms are eroding fastest. Ever vigilant, he strives to disrupt the vengeful plots of Heaven's cast-down and cursed angel horde. With his two most-trusted friends, the former-U.S. Marshal Catalina Mancuso, and the eccentrically animated Rory Pembrook, Joshua has always managed to keep the Fallen at bay. Until now. An ancient prophecy has awakened and taken root inside a very unique host. Once unleashed, the apocalyptic explosion that follows will engulf the world in a tide of violence the likes of which has never been seen. Will Joshua's diminished heavenly powers, Catalina's combat prowess and Rory's unrivaled intellect be strong enough to stop Armageddon? How long can the trinity of defenders stand against the dark forces bent on stopping them?",
