            "The series focuses on the infamous crime that shocked the nation and was chronicled in Truman Capote's seminal book, In Cold Blood - the Nov. 15, 1959 brutal murder of four members of the Clutter family in their home in a small Kansas farming community, a crime seemingly without motive. This true crime documentary takes a fresh in-depth look at the legendary case - digging into the resulting investigation, and the convictions and executions of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock. _Cold Blooded_ (qv): The Clutter Family Murders draws from the first-hand accounts of relatives, family friends, townspeople and law enforcement - some of whom have never spoken publicly before. In addition to commentary from surviving Clutter family members, there are new insights from Paul Dewey, son of Alvin Dewey, who was the Kansas Bureau of Investigation's lead detective on the case; Gerald Clarke, Truman Capote biographer and friend; and actor Scott Wilson, who played murderer Richard \"Dick\" Hickock in the Academy Award-nominated motion picture, among others. The series also presents never-before-seen details such as original photographs, audio recordings, and documents from the case, as well as memoirs and letters from the murderers and their families. Through this immersive investigation, the true crime docuseries deepens our understanding of this notorious crime and explores the role it played in the American psyche."
