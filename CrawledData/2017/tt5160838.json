Her student collegue falls in love with her and wants to help her, but he is forced to finish his studies quickly because of his family's desperate financial situation. After several years they meet again and get married. She informed him she was arrested by the police for her political protests. Was he the traitor who informed the police because he didn´t want to lose her?"
