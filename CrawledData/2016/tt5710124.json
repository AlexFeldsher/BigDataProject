Katie Didd, an honest, offbeat young Actress with an infectious personality took it upon herself to bring Amy out of her funk and consequently take over Amy's life with her always loveable but often officious ways. Occasionally pushing Amy to her limits but perhaps more importantly pushing Amy out of her comfort zone as the two girl's lives become more and more intertwined, both trying to navigate love, life and LA in this weird and wonderful world. Katie might just become that friend Amy never wanted but always needed.",
