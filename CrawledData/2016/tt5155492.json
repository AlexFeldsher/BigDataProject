The work is professional and high quality, but as a close group of friends who consider each other family, it can often come with a fair share of drama. This crew has had their work featured in various car shows, and maintains clients from all the way over in France. They specialize in the American Muscle Car and the American Classic Car, and are well known within the Portland automotive community.",
