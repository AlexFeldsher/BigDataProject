Through compelling patient stories and insights from medical experts, Path to a Breakthrough sheds light on how medical innovations, including Precision Medicine, Immunotherapy, and Biologics, are providing doctors with powerful new tools to treat disease, alleviate symptoms, and in some cases, reverse the course of debilitating illness. In this extraordinary new series, WebMD and Roberts share the stories of Cara, a 4-year-old girl who lost, then regained her ability to walk from the clues hidden in her genetic makeup; Trevor, a man diagnosed with stage IV Lymphoma in the prime of his life, and the doctor who helped him harness his own immune system for a nontoxic cancer treatment; Kevin, whose pain from dirt bike racing injuries was nothing compared to the excruciating pain of Rheumatoid Arthritis; Falisha, whose life-changing diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis was alleviated by biologics; and Rebecca, whose debilitating Psoriasis led to blindness.",
