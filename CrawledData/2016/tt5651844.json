            "Travellers is a Sci Fi TV show with the premise of a time travel as a backdrop. There is a team of 5 travellers, who travel from a bleak and very dark future under the guidance or orders of a mysterious \"Director\". Essentially they are able to project/transfer their conscious to a human being who's either dying or about to die in 21st century. Each team consists of a Historian, a Medic/Doctor, two soldiers and one leader. Their conscious is transferred to random person of the same sex as the person from future. They inherit and pretend to live the life of their host, while working on their mission. The historian is knowledgeable and recite events that are in store or in future in 21st century, thus being able to affect or change those events.It is alluded that there are other similar teams on different missions on a tight compartmentalized need to know basis."
