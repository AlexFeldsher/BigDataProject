Lions and leopards plot their attacks on migrating beasts in order to feed their cubs. Standing tall like a beacon of brilliant green in this bleak landscape stands something that defies nature's rhythms: a sausage tree. It's a miracle of Zambia that bears sweet gifts of large fruits and crimson flowers that sustain these wild residents until the unforgiving season ends.    "

It's the camelthorn, one of only a handful of large trees that can take root in the Kalahari's deficient soil. Discover the evolutionary secrets that allow it to tower as a master of survival in the vast expanses of these African plains, where living is an often unthinkable challenge.    "
