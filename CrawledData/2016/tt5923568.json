            "This time the editorial board of the weekly women's magazine «XXS» was not bored at all. The participants didn't discuss the cover, or the pages layout, or horoscopes column. Serious passions ran high around the topic of the November issue: What do men want?Three wordsmiths three main authors of the magazine took part in the battle: Lisa (Fatima Gorbenko), Veronica (Yuliya Zimina\") and Olya (Elena Muravyova).Lisa stood out for the intelligent matching with the high demands of a modern man: in her opinion only witty, bright woman with a wide range of interests enjoy success today.Veronica competently assured that it would take her fifteen minutes to woo a man away even from a Nobel laureate its just a matter of high hills and a bit of rouge on the lips.Olya said that they could even start a fight for the mens attention, and yes, they would be asked for a date... But men get married to like women like herself: cozy, cute and domestic.Finally Mikhail Mikhailovich Ilyin (Konstantin Solovyov), the editor in chief, slammed his fist on the table: Enough of hollow words, go and prove it! Ill see you here in a month: the one who gets more offers of marriage will write the main article. However, the director has his own answer to the question: \"What do men want?\"For the purity of the experiment, he wrote it down right there during the editorial board, and sealed it in the envelope. Well see in a month if he guessed or not.Men, beware! Three brilliant women are out on a hunt, and you may become their trophies! Each of the characters will have a very unusual journey and learn a lot of new about men. And of course they will find their true love."
