            "Scripted comedy that lovingly satirizes the reality singing competitions that have become a centerpiece of pop culture. When SING IT's executive producer is fired, Stacy Needles' plan to take charge is thwarted with the arrival of newcomer indie producer, Drew. His inexperience and blind passion threaten to off-set the dysfunctional workplace family comprised of duplicitous executives, a rollicking crew, and quirky contestants who are eliminated from the competition each week."
