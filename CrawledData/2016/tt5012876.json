            "Westmore has always been a small pleasant little town. Filled with your typical small town concession. The local high school, town hall, small mom and pop shops and a dark secret that has been guarded since before our membories can recall. Among the people of Westmore lives a small community of demi god's and goddesses, their goal is to live peacefully and respectfully. Bust not all is well in Westmore, there are fractions of demigod's that wish to rule the mortals as in the days of myth and legend and they will tear the town apart to do so."
