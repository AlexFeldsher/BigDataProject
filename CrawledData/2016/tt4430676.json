Henry Seele, the demon in question, has hidden for years away from the eyes of the Wardens (a group of highly trained individuals who track demons to their deaths) and the vigilante demon hunters. His inherent blood lust brings him to inadvertent exposure when two would-be demon hunters, Calvin Shaw and Ian Howe, are tipped off to Henry's true nature. Calvin and Ian investigate Henry quietly, unaware that Henry is watching them every step of the way, and waiting for them to strike. Calvin and Ian set a trap for Henry, which backfires; Ian is killed and Calvin barely escapes with his life. However, Henry is taken captive by a mysterious being and brought to places unknown. Calvin, with the help of Ian's wealthy and influential family, must discover the whereabouts of Henry Seele and exact justice. Little does he realize that the world is about to enter a state of war, as the dormant foes of the many hidden demons in the world are slowly revealing themselves.",
