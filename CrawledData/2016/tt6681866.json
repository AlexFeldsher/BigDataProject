Our characters are four doctors of an emergency care hospital. Each one has their own story about choosing medicine for career; all of them use different methods of treatment. One is totally committed to the hospital; another manages to achieve some kind of work-life balance. These four are no superheroes, but instead they are people who are on call 24/7 to save the lives of others.",
