Michael (Danson) is the architect who oversees the town--and this is the first one he has been in charge of creating. Eleanor (Bell) arrives at the Good Place and realizes they have her name right, but everything else is wrong. She isn't meant to be there at all. With the help of Chidi, her soul mate (Harper), Eleanor tries to right her wrongs, seeking to finally earn her spot in the Good Place.::carly lawless",
            "American Eleanor Shellstrop has just passed away, her spirit's final resting place being \"the good place\" (as opposed to \"the bad place\" where most go after they die). Spirits in the good place live in specially designed neighborhoods - Michael being the architect of Eleanor's neighborhood - with a small group of the best of other good spirits. All spirits are paired with soul mates, Eleanor's being a Senagalese ethicist named Chidi Anagonye. The entire situation is meant to be paradise for the residents, but this Eleanor Shellstrop is not the Eleanor Shellstrop Michael believes her to be, this Eleanor was selfish and self-absorbed, an attitude she takes into the good place. Based partly on what little she knows about the bad place, Eleanor wants to stay in the good place, which means that she is constantly looking over her shoulder so as not to be caught as a fraud, specifically by Michael. She also wants to turn her attitude around so that she deserves to be there, which she hopes to do with the help of her soul mate. But if Eleanor does not belong in the neighborhood, what else could be wrong with the good place?::Huggo",

She, her soulmate Chidi, their neighbors Tahani and Jason (who also doesn't belong) drive each other insane and torture each other trying to figure who gets to stay and who Michael sends away to the bad place.",

Worried that she will be sent to the bad place, if anyone finds out, she meets Chidi Anagonye who will try to help her become a better person.::Lorenz Golser"
