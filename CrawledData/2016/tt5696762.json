Amanda, the beauty and brains of Martin Bros Customs, keeps the jobs rolling out and the dollars rolling in with her uncanny knowledge of every backwoods shed and car lot in the state.

Then it's back to Martin Bros Customs where Joe's small but mighty team of Shorty, Mike, Jason, Manny and Pompa work metal magic on Shag and Amanda's finds in order to turn Joe's vision for the unpolished gems into shiny, hot rod reality. In the end Shag works his magic with a new buyer to get the highest price for the revived Martin Bros Customs creation. Raising the dead is never easy, but together this Texas team of gearheads can restore any rusted pile of metal into the hottest cars and craziest choppers in the world.",
