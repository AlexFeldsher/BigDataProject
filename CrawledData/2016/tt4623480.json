He gives Stacy control over _The Wok_ (qv) because he wants to teach her the value of hard work and not to expect that a rich husband will take care of her. _The Wok_ (qv) is understaffed at the moment and Stacy needs to fill in positions quickly to get the restaurant running again. She contacts three of her former college lovers: Dave, Ricky and Matt to come help her work at the restaurant. By hiring her ex-boyfriends on the cheap, Stacy sets herself up for more dysfunctional interactions with the guys and everyone else around her."
