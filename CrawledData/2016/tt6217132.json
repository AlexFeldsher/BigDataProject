A call in which the police have claimed to be proof of his apparent suicide. From the highest-ranking political power to the lowest-level burnout, no one is above suspicion of murder. As Grace infiltrates the social and political web more deeply, her theory solidifies and each player's role becomes clear, from the mystery woman who has offered her help, to the shifty police department. Grace may soon be ready to make her case, even if it's too late for her to get out.",
