            "[PART 1 - Land of Flying Snakes] Due to changing sea levels, Borneo has regularly been connected by land to nearby Malay/ Indonesian areas, resulting in a varied, often unique mix of wildlife adapted to its largely pristine landscapes, mainly jungle, half of which comprises the world's highest trees family. Various species learned to live or hunt in high canopies, some by gliding, including snakes. Most famous is Asia's only ape, the orang utan, but the salty crocodile or birds are no less interesting.::KGF Vissers"
