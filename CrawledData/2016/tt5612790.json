        "synopsis": [
            "Hors Circuits is a documentary series of hour-long episodes that explore abandoned, isolated, and sometimes forbidden places in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Shot with the cinematographic eye of an award-winning production team, these episodes marry the small screen with the film aesthetics of the theatrical release to bring you world class imagery. Abandoned villages, victim of progress, 16th century whaling stations, underground caverns with a murky history, Newfoundland is filled with the physical testimonies of our evolution. These are often out of bounds, restricted, inaccessible and very often extremely dangerous structures.Local legends, spectacular vistas, and historic events are woven into the adventure as Jennifer searches for these hard to find and rugged places. Along the way, Jennifer our guide meets residents and shares a little of their daily life, learning the stories of the people and their place, seeking answers to her questions: what happened here? Why did the people leave? And will they ever come back?Jennifer travels over the land or under it, paddles the ocean or dives below to explore these sites and their stories. With blood, sweat and tears she is exposing what the daily life was back then, revealing the poignant heritage of our human endeavor; What it was to be there then, what it means today. Old footsteps are dusted so to reveal Mother nature's plan through the beauty, tones and textures of decay. One can only wonder what their true vocation is when buildings are built, occupied over a few years and have been abandoned for ages. Most of these sites have never been seen, they have never been filmed, we offer one last step, one last look before they vanish forever."
