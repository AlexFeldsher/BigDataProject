Burning with vengeance against the humans who abandoned her, Oban manipulates the other toys to attack people. Meanwhile, Oban's nemesis, the Masked Chukonen, is also given life at the same time. Masked Chukonen really looks like a sad middle-aged, metabolic-syndrome sufferer, but when he eats instant noodles he is charged with energy and transformed into a superhero.
