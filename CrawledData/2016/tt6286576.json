He chose her career and caused her breakup with her husband Victor, despite the fact that they have a daughter. Sinitsyn is used to control everything and everyone, and he can't even imagine how dramatically the life of his family will change soon. One day Aurora visits an abandoned noble estate and gets a souvenir: an old hatbox containing letters in French and a black lady's glove. The inscription on the box says: \"Aurora\" as it belonged to the famous beauty of the XIX century Aurora Gernval. People called her Fate Aurora because she brought bad luck to all the men who had loved her. As soon as Aurora Sinitsyna brings the box home and tries on a glove of Aurora Gernval, she gets into a whirlpool of troubles. Her godfather gets seriously injured from a gun, her father is accused of attempted murder, some people watch their home and all members of the family receive threatening messages: \"Give it back!\" But Aurora won't give up. She does not believe in old curses and she can recognize the insidious intent behind the mystical fog. Aurora will do anything to save her family and to return her love.",
