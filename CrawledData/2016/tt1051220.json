Amberle Elessedil is the only one who can save the tree. But she has to unlock magic that the Elves haven't used in thousands of years. With the help of Wil Ohmsford, she travels to find the lost magic. But it won't be an easy task.::Chris Green",
            "The Four Lands, normally a land of magic and peace, faces a threat beyond man: Demons. Banished ages ago, they were held back by a magical wall known as the Forbidding. Yet the source of that magic, the magical tree known as the Ellcrys, is dying, and thus the wall wanes. When the acolytes who tend to the tree are all killed, the wise Druid Allanon turns to Amberle, the last remaining disciple, to save the tree. Only she can take the seed of the Elven tree to the faraway Bloodfire, to replant the Ellcrys and stop the Demons. To protect her, Allanon sends the young Wil Ohmsford, a descendant of heroes past. As the two youths head on a perilous journey, Allanon and the entire Elven Nation stand together to hold back the Demons and stop them from destroying the Four Lands.::Wishsong214"

But when the magic begins to fail and the demons threaten to overtake the Four Lands, it is up to Wil Ohmsford, grandson of legendary Shea Ohmsford, with the help of the druid Allanon to repel the impending hordes from the prison sealed shut by the Ellcrys. To do this, he must open himself to a magic closed inside him and use the Elfstones to protect the Ellcrys' Chosen on a perilous journey. Together, they must race against the demons' march toward the Elven capitol Arborlon to a place called Safehold to figure out the riddle of restoring the magic held by the dying Ellcrys, but an unknown terror tracks them relentlessly..."
