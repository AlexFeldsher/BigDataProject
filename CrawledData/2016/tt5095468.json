            "ADOPTABLE! is an awkward and bittersweet comic web series written by and starring Scott Lowell loosely based on his own experiences searching for his birth parents back in the late 90s. It is presented as a documentary being directed by Jennifer Lim (Linda Park of TVs Enterprise & Crash) which follows successful actor and adult adoptee Scott Fishman (Lowell) of the hit TV show Cops & Bottoms in which he co-stars with Noah Wyle (Noah Wyle as a fictionalized version of himself). Bowing somewhat to pressure from his fiancé, Lisa Crane (Emily Swallow, The Mentalist, Monday Mornings) and their therapist Bob Raskin (Jim OHeir of Parks and Recreation) as well as his own desire to know himself a bit better before getting married and starting a family, Fishman embarks on the journey of seeking out his birth parents. He is aided along the way by an intermediary named Mary Elizabeths played by multi-Emmy Award® winner Sharon Gless (Cagney & Lacey, Burn Notice, Queer as Folk)."
