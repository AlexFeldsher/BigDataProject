A buddy comedy about the pursuit of happiness, the search for love, and the drinks you share along the way. For the past eight years Marvin has worked at the same job, lived in the same apartment, drank the same brand of whiskey, the same wine, the same beer, the same vodka, and the same cognac (when he's feeling fancy). He has succumbed to the miserable life of a mid-30's man with no grand ambitions. One night amid his drunken despair, Marvin is befriended by a talking rodent known simply as Rat. Brash and forthright, Rat sees something he likes about Marvin. Though a little mystified at first, talking to a rodent comes surprisingly easy to Marvin. Turns out drinking partners come in all shapes, sizes and species. In season one, Marvin is desperate to get back together with his ex, Molly, believing this will truly make him happy and life worth living. Rat, being a stand-up rodent, decides to help his new friend get the girl. Needless to say, Rat's best intentions are often derailed by his selfish and indulgent behaviour. And even though Marvin tries to be the clearheaded one, he constantly finds himself pulled down the rabbit (rat) hole by his new friend and confidant.",
