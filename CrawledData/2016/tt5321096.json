She plans to quit volleyball and start playing the flute, because it's more pretty and feminine, even though she was a star volleyball player in middle school, and she's never played the flute before. Also joining the wind instrument club is Haruta, her old childhood friend who she hasn't seen in nine years! Delicate and smart, the two are polar opposites. Chika's time in the wind instrument club doesn't go as smoothly as she hopes. First of all, there are only five members of the club! Second of all, mysterious things keep happening... Who knew a music club could be so fraught with mystery?",
