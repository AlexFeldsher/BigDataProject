The episodes follow the two actresses through several casting and production adventures, and each episode is shot in the style of the subject matter that inspired it. The first two episodes are inspired by Pop-Up Video, Blind Date and Lifetime Original Movies. The series is filled out with episodes inspired by Tarantino, Wes Andersen, and cult documentaries. The result is a comical competition composed of underhanded tactics, blatant sabotage and physical violence between the two. It is a singularly hilarious portrait of the contentious relationship between these two women and ultimately between people and the often exaggerated image of success and happiness that they struggle to project.",
