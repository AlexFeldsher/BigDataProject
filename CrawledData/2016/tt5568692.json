        "plot outline": "It's \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" meets \"Goodfellas\" meets \"Glee.\" In the 1990's, Tony Finelli, an Italian-American from New York (Mark Janicello) was a star in Europe. Tony found fame playing the King of Rock and Roll in \"ELVIS: The Musical\" and together with his ever-present Manager, Jürgen, turned that initial success into an international singing career. In 1997, Jürgen, was contacted by an \"Italian Concert Promoter\" supposedly representing \"Mr. Big,\" (Godfather of the Gambaretto Mafia Family), regarding a big concert for Tony in Sicily. Actually, this \"promoter\" was an undercover Agent working for the German CIA, leading a secret sting operation to arrest Mr. Big, who was under investigation for both tax evasion and money laundering. Tony and Jürgen were handed the choice of either going to prison for Mr. Big or watching both of their families get murdered by the mob. The Series begins on the day Tony and Jürgen are being released from a 15-year sentence in Moabit Prison in Berlin. No one meets them at the gate. Tony returns to his former home in the well-to-do neighborhood of Charlottenburg in Berlin, in order to rebuild his life. Unbeknownst to Tony, shortly before his release, Tony's ex-wife (Chris)Tina Finelli, a former Model and Stewardess from Russia, filed for divorce. When Tony got arrested, Tina was left with 2 small children. The scandal surrounding Tony's arrest, ruined her reputation, and she had no income.
