After being on the run from their school-a special academy for moroi and dhampirs-for over a year, Rose and Lissa are dragged back into the dangerous and terrifying world of high school. Only drama queens and bad boys, Rose suspects, might not be the most dangerous things lurking inside the gates of St. Vladimir's Academy. With the help of Lissa's new official guardian, Dimitri, Rose struggles to protect Lissa from unknown and powerful forces.
