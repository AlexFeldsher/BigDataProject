WERNER sits on the other side of that table. He's an ambitious detective who caught a lucky break, but didn't need it.

As he digs deeper into Sydney's underbelly he begins to learn that while MICHAEL may have done what they say he did, he certainly isn't guilty. With WERNER exhuming a best-forgotten past while hunting a missing person-of-interest no one wants found, MICHAEL turns his attention to the present since what better pool of suspects and informants can be found than in a prison.",
