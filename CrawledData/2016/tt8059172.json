            "Over the course of 30 days one unsuspecting member of the public is secretly filmed with hidden camera's until suddenly he finds himself in a TV-studio to play the game-show of his life.You're in control of your own life. At least that's what you think. But what if that isn't the case? What if an entire team of TV professionals is controlling your life, without you even realizing it? What if every event, every encounter in your life is all part of a game that you know nothing about? In Sorry About That one unsuspecting member of the public unwittingly stars in a game about his own life. For an entire month, he is followed by hidden cameras and finds himself in unusual situations, without having a single clue about what's going on. All the protagonist's family members and friends are in on one big conspiracy focused on the protagonist's life. At the end of the month, the candidate is tricked into coming to a special location, where he must play the game of his life. We collectively apologize and give away personalized prizes in a thrilling four-round quiz and a grand finale, about the past thirty days of our candidate's life. Do you still remember the answer to this question after we spelled it out in gigantic letters on the roof of your house? Will you be able to figure out that your favorite celebrity took a shower in your bathroom while you were home? Did you really become the national champion, or did we invent this sport just for you? Nobody ever expects something this big to happen to them. Well: Sorry about that"
