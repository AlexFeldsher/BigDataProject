            "In 1923 in London Emily French, a glamorous and wealthy middle-aged widow picks up young waiter Leonard Vole and pays him to be her lover, to the disgust of her loyal housekeeper Janet McIntyre. When she is murdered Leonard, as the chief beneficiary in her will, is arrested but tells his solicitor John Mayhew that his common law wife, actress Romaine, can give him an alibi. John feels sorry for the youngster, who, like his dead son, fought in the trenches and brings in cynical barrister Sir Charles Carter to represent him. He is also captivated by Romaine and stunned when she refuses to support him, becoming instead a witness for the prosecution. As the trial progresses the evidence against Leonard mounts, largely due to Romaine's testimony. Then a mystery woman meets with John with information that will discredit her as a liar and a bigamist, which leads to Leonard's acquittal. Some years later John meets up with Leonard again and is in for a shock.::don @ minifie-1"
