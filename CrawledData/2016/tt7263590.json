        "plot outline": "'Eve' (Ice Preechaya) is living her dream - literally. Eve sees her future in her dreams and so far everything that happens in her dreams comes true. Although her life seems perfect, there is one thing that has not come true yet - 'Meeting the man of her dreams'- a rising engineer whom she will fall in love with and marry. She thinks her destiny is so set in stone that she closes the door on every guy who walks into her life, waiting for only the 'man of her dreams'. But when she finally runs into 'the man of her dreams', the guy she is going to spend the rest of her life with turns out not to be the rising engineer but instead a gas attendent (GSA). 'Pun' (Ice Nattharat) is an ordinary gas station attendant, but looks just like the man in Eve's dreams. Eve, believing there must be something wrong, sets out to prove whether this gas jockey really can be her dream come true.",
