            "Heads of state are elusive figures, shielded by high security, tall gates, and press advisers. But what if we could look through a rare window into their hearts and minds? What if they allowed us to see the real person behind the personae?First Person takes viewers around the world to meet the most compelling state leaders of our time. In candid testimonies delivered in an intimate setting, presidents, monarchs, and heads of government past and present forego the prepared speeches, talking points and staged photo-ops to deliver intimate, first person accounts of their extraordinary lives, revealing a deeply human side of politics, power and leadership."
