Lenny lives with his parents near Bordeaux. A big fan of LoL, this teenager spends his free time in e-sports bars with his friends. Together, they formed an amateur team and are making their debut in a regional lan at the Bordeaux Geek Festival. While Lenny dreams of becoming a pro-gamer, sOAZ and his teammates, xPeke, Alvar and Amazing experience the anguish of poor results: for them e-sports is not a game anymore, it's a demanding - and sometimes cruel - discipline. The story is told in six episodes of approx. 8 minutes each. The series shows the game and how it works, but focuses mostly on the humanity of these gamers, their professionalism, far from the clichés that reduce them to antisocial geeks, devoid of talent.",
