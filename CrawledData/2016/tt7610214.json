        "synopsis": [
            "Visit beautiful and exciting locations from around the world, as you've never seen them before, as two daredevil free runners challenge themselves to run across beautiful cities. In 2003, Jump London introduced \"Free Running\" to the world - the ability to freely move anywhere, where obstacles are the fun part of the journey. Now, this exceptional travel-log takes viewers to the most beautiful cities on earth, but looks at them from a truly unique angle - the rooftops.Brothers Max and Benj Cave are two of the UK's best free runners. Having trained and taught themselves here in Britain they're now keen to explore the world and put their incredible skills to the test. The boys will be using their connections within the parkour community to meet up with a fellow local free runner and be challenged to recreate and undertake a cool running route.In each episode, our free-runners are given a challenge by an expert to complete routes that explore a location's history and culture, from a never-seen-before perspective. They explore Santorini from the top of the iconic blue and white roofs, run the full length of the Olympic Park in London and uncover Croatian abandoned aluminium factories as our two fitness-freaks flip, leap and dive from building to building. Each and every location comes with its own set of challenges that the runners must overcome, from treacherous abandoned buildings surrounded by glass and rubble to scaling staggering heights up the monuments of London and Paris.The local experts they meet are some of the best in the parkour world and are there to guide Max and Benj to hidden and unique training spots around the cities. As the experts set them differing and daring challenges in each episode, the pair's creativity and skills are put to the test. Is there anything the brothers can't tackle?"
