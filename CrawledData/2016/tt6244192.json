With her personal experience acting as a driving force, Remini -- along with high-level former Scientology executives and members -- relates shocking stories of abuse and harassment alleged by ex-practitioners who claim their lives have been affected even well after they left the organization. The Church of Scientology, which has made multiple attempts to have A&E Network pull the series, refers to Remini as a \"has-been actress\" who's exploiting her former religion to make money.::Jwelch5742"
