The clinic is run by the brilliant Dr. Mann who has hand-picked these five psych students for their unique gifts. But to Dr. Mann, there is no God - there is only the DSM. Here in the clinic, the students' behavior is called out, analyzed, and poked fun at, as it creates conflicts with patients, advisors and each other. In short, this show is about a small group of student trainees who try (and sometimes fail) to set aside their own problems in order to help others with theirs. Their patients' struggles in some way highlight their own struggles, which point our psych students toward a new, deeper understanding of themselves.",
