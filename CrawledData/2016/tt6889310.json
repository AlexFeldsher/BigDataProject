Gradually the two protagonists become staunch friends, where Dhaani comes under a pre conceived notion that Sameer loves her. She asks him to send a proposal, but in return she finds out that he never considered her more than a friend. There is a twist in fate when the two protagonists get separate by getting engaged to someone else,which ultimately leads to realizations and repercussions. Raja adds to the drama by taking revenge from Sameer for hurting Dhaani, which opens a new chapter in the lives of Dhaani, Sameer and Raja.",
