            "It is the story of teen fraternal twins who run away with a travelling circus to escape a villainess who is after them. After their parents myseriously disappear, the siblings rely on the protection of a rag-tag group of circus performers that include a magician, a fire-breather, an acrobat, a strongman, and a clairvoyant. In the middle of this cat-and- mouse chase, the siblings discover that their new circus family is a group of magical folk in disguise. The circus becomes key to revealing the truth about the siblings' identities as they will eventually discover that they have their own powers."
