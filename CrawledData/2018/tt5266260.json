            "'_La verdad_ (qv)', a fiction broadcast on Telecinco and produced by Plano a Plano, narrates the disappearance of a little girl, Paula García, in very strange circumstances that, after eight years, reappears in the lives of her family and friends with age 17 years old. Marcos Eguía is a young policeman who is assigned the case to investigate the mysterious return after the appearance of Paula, when everyone thought she was dead. However, not everyone will make the return of the girl simple, among them Lalo Ruiz, the journalist who covered the news eight years before and who suspects that the family is involved in the disappearance and who does not trust who says Paula is, really, the girl who disappeared eight years ago. In the difficult circumstance of throwing light on the mysterious case, the agent Eguía will end up falling in love with Paula, generating greater complications to the investigation."
