As Sarah searches for inspiration for her new restaurant and menu, her adventures take her deep into the streets and markets of this vast city as she seeks out exciting food and fresh produce. For this menu Sarah will be using more spices and bolder flavours in order to cater to the Indian palette. It's a new style of cooking for Sarah and she'll need to learn fast. With only a short time to fit out the restaurant, develop her new menu and train new staff, Sarah once again finds herself straining under the weight of expectation. In an industry where only one out of three new restaurants survive, can a newcomer like Sarah really succeed in the ultra competitive Mumbai restaurant scene?",
