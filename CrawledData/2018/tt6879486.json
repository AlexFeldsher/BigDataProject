Until a similar case brings all the old memories back and she resolves to finally get to the bottom of Marie's disappearance. Especially when evidence suggests that the two cases could be linked - together with some other unsolved murders. Taking matters into her own hands, she initiates some unconventional investigations of her own, and finds out more than she bargained for.
