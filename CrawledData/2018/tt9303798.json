Twenty years ago, the head of the family George Tarmanov had founded the company \"Max-Farm\", which became one of the leaders in the international pharmaceutical market. At the present time his children Anna, Boris and Victor form the board of directors. The brothers hope to elbow the sister out of the board and to get their hands on the company after the death of the father. But the will of late George shocks the family: it turns out that he left all the fortune to Anna's son, his grandson Maxim Tarmanov, who had drowned in the sea 12 years ago. And soon Maxim appears. The young man claims that he was kidnapped, all these years he was kept on some farm, depriving communication with the outside world, and only now he was released to freedom without explanation - A happy mother is ready for anything, so that her newly-found son does not feel unwanted in his own family. But later she begins to feel that this boy, who for some reason lost 12 years of normal life, did not come to them with peace.",
