        "plot outline": "Varun and Jaggu return as a married couple on a mission to save Balaraju's wedding- while there is trouble brewing in their own marriage Varun and Jagadamba are married and have been living together for over a year now in Hyderabad. Like every marriage, their relationship also goes through a lot of ups and downs. Their fights are hilariously cute and give us a sense of a young couple who are in love but due to their ego and misunderstandings start turning small things into a big deal. Slowly distance between them increases and things get serious to the extent that Jagadamba wants to file for a divorce. Varun is surprised to hear this and feels that little things should be ignored and they should move on. However, Jagadamba is not willing to hear him out. She wants to go to Amalapuram, call both families to explain their situation and file for a divorce. At Amalapuram, family members are gathered and just when Varun and Jagadamba are about to talk about their divorce, the couple learns that Balaraju's wedding is arranged with Manasa, a beautiful girl from a neighboring town who he meets at Suresh Krishnan's daughters wedding. Suresh Krishnan is a businessman and owns a chain of Hospitals in the Eastern part of Andhra Pradesh. Now, Varun and Jagadamba find it inappropriate to talk about their personal issue while everyone is happy and elated about the good news. They decide to wait until the wedding is over to tell everyone. While the wedding preparations are going on full swing, Jagadamba finds out that Manasa is in love with a wedding videographer from Rajahmundry. Jagadamba also notices that Balaraju is madly in love with Manasa and does not want to see his heart broken once again. Jagadamba decides to seek Varun's help to change Manasa's choice and convince her to marry Balaraju. The week before the wedding is full of festivities and packed with fun-filled ceremonies. The boys- Varun, Krishna, Nitin (Varun's friend who is visiting from Hyderabad), decide to throw a bachelor party in Peddapuram for Balaraju. Peddapuram is known as a guys hideout for small towner's and they decide to have one last night of fun and frolic before Balaraju's wedding. While the boys are gone, a group of people arrives at the marriage house to kidnap the bride. The group mistakenly kidnaps Jagadamba instead of Manasa. While there are just a few days remaining for the wedding, Varun, Balaraju and the boys head out to look for Jagadamba and promise everyone to come back before the muhurtham. Jagadamba is kidnapped by the Videographer as he mistakes her for Manasa. While being captive, Jagadamba finds out that the Videographers is not really serious about marrying Manasa but does this in an attempt to get his past revenge with Balaraju. Now Jagadamba after learning his true colors is all the more determined to ensure Balaraju and Manasa get married. As a team Varun, Balaraju, Krishna device a plan to make Manasa realize Balaraju's worth an also show her the videographers' true colors. Amidst all the fun and chaos of this wedding, Varun and Jagadamba realizes that if they can go to any extent to unite a couple and save a wedding then why aren't they making an effort to save their own marriage. They take a leap towards getting the spark back in their marriage; Balaraju and Manasa get married and another season of Pelli Gola reaches a happy ending.",
