It tells the story of Joe 'il-Paps' Bonavia , father of five who returns from prison to a life in ruins. His girlfriend Lena and mother to his baby boy Zac, has eloped with his business partner Jeffrey with whom Paps was planning to demolish Lena's inherited farmhouse to be replaced by apartments. But now his plans have come to nothing and Paps finds himself penniless, jobless, with four young mouths to feed and facing eviction. He looks for help from his brother, Halsaflieni's young Parish Priest, Father Randolf, who in turn introduces him to Princess a young immigrant in need of a job and a place to stay. From the outset the relationship is off to a bad start due to Paps's racist beliefs and Princess's feisty temperament. Meanwhile Paps decides he needs a radical plan if he is to hope to win back Lena, thwart Jeffrey and get his life back on track. What he needs is nothing short of a Miracle! In spite of their mutual dislike, Paps and Princess soon discover they desperately need one another if they are to pull out from a rapidly deteriorating series of events ignited by Paps's master plan that might lead them into serious trouble with all the powers that be.",
