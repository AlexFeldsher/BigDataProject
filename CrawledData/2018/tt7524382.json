        "plot outline": "'STATH LETS FLATS' is a brand new 6x30min sitcom for E4, written by and starring one of the UK's leading young character comedians, JAMIE DEMETRIOU (Fleabag, Paddington) - described by the Independent as 'a Steve Coogan in the making.' Main character Stath is a chaotic but well-meaning lettings agent, working for his Greek-Cypriot father in North London. Across the series, Stath tries to prove himself a worthy heir to the family business, 'Michael and Eagle', despite his epic incompetence and divisive personality. Against the backdrop of London's crazy property market, STATH is a highly original workplace comedy with family at its heart, which offers a unique glimpse of Greek-Cypriot life in the city. The series is co-written by Robert Popper (Peep Show, Friday Night Dinner) and directed by Tom Kingsley, director Pls Like (BBC3) and BAFTA-nominated feature Black Pond.",
