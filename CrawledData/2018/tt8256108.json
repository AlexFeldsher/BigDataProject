        "plot outline": "@DATINGZOE is a breakthrough new comedy based on the real-life dating struggles of a lesbian in New York City: Zoe's been on more dates than she cares to admit. She's experienced a decade of dating fails, and her hopeless romantic days are long gone. She can't help but wonder what she could possibly be doing wrong, and she wants help figuring it out. Enter Devon. She's Zoe's go-to girl as they navigate the New York City lesbian dating scene together. Because the old ways haven't been working, they're taking a new approach. Zoe's got yet another upcoming date, and with permission from the girl she's going out with, Devon will come along to film Zoe and her date in action. The plan is to share the date on social media and get a little insight from fresh eyes on why Zoe's dating skills have failed her. @DATINGZOE is a mockumentary-style comedy series with Devon's camera providing the central vantage point. Although Devon is a main character, we first get to know her only through her voice as she interacts with Zoe on camera. This uniquely personal format allows for an authentic connection between viewers and our relatable characters.",
