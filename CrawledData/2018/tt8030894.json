Although the subject is often discussed in an international context, thousands of people are trafficked for sex in the U.S. alone each year, and thousands more sell sex under varying levels of compulsion, constrained decisions and choice. This series shows viewers how our culture of paying for sex affects a broad range of people who end up in the sex trade, from children being trafficked by opioid addicts, to life in America's most elite brothel. And the series takes a look at the frontlines of combating exploitation and harm in the industry. With moving storytelling and videography as well as hard-hitting investigative journalism, Sold in America pulls back the curtain on our nation's sex trade.",
