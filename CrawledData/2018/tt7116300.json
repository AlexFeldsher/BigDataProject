        "plot outline": "Robert Kastell returns to Sweden after having been presumed dead for thirty years. A personal tragedy has made him leave his exile, and sent him on a last journey of revenge - - the target being the successful arms trade broker Anders Speths. Robert is soon discovered by Rolf Höglund, a conspiracy theorist and former journalist. Rolfs tries to persuade Robert to focus on exposing the double standards and illegal deals behind the Swedish arms industry, rather that his personal vendetta. Robert knows that much of what Rolf talks about is true. He was himself a part of this dirty business before he faked his death and fled the country. When Rolf mysteriously disappears, his daughter Åsa gets very worried and filled with guilt. The last thing she said to her father was that he was crazy conspiracy theorist and an alcoholic. Her husband Mario uses Rolf's history with addiction to ease her worries. He's probably only on a binge. He'll soon turn up again. Meanwhile, Anders Speths - - who is helping his daughter Johanna back after a tough battle with mental illness/OCD - - is offered to negotiate a big weapon deal between the Indonesian state and the Belgian/Swedish weapon manufacturer Sandersvik, run by CEO Maggie van Haal.

            "Robert Kastell returns to Sweden after having been presumed dead for thirty years. A personal tragedy has made him leave his exile, and sent him on a last journey of revenge - - the target being the successful arms trade broker Anders Speths. Robert is soon discovered by Rolf Höglund, a conspiracy theorist and former journalist. Rolfs tries to persuade Robert to focus on exposing the double standards and illegal deals behind the Swedish arms industry, rather that his personal vendetta. Robert knows that much of what Rolf talks about is true. He was himself a part of this dirty business before he faked his death and fled the country. When Rolf mysteriously disappears, his daughter Åsa gets very worried and filled with guilt. The last thing she said to her father was that he was crazy conspiracy theorist and an alcoholic. Her husband Mario uses Rolf's history with addiction to ease her worries. He's probably only on a binge. He'll soon turn up again. Meanwhile, Anders Speths - - who is helping his daughter Johanna back after a tough battle with mental illness/OCD - - is offered to negotiate a big weapon deal between the Indonesian state and the Belgian/Swedish weapon manufacturer Sandersvik, run by CEO Maggie van Haal. Sandersvik has been in a negative spiral for years and this new deal may be just what the company needs to break it."
