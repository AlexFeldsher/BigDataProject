They all have one thing in common though, they can all agree that Jack is heartless and he isn't afraid to show it. He seems to stir the pot whether he wants to or not. The night begins to go array when the counselors have their fair share of drinks and begin to split up. There are fights, break-ups, blossoming romances, and decisions made that will change the course of the entire summer. Camp Chikawala is known for \"fresh air, everlasting friendships, and unforgettable moments\", but this summer will be nothing but despair, mystery, and terrible decisions.",
