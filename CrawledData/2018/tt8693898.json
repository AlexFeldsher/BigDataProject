            "IN THE MAKING is an immersive journey inside the creative process. The documentary series follows host Sean O'Neill across the country and around the world alongside some of Canada's leading artists as they bring new work to life and face pivotal moments of risk and reward.Each episode follows an artist from across the creative spectrum-visual art, film, music, dance, theatre-with a unique approach to art making and something to say about the world. Sean visits artists at home, in studio, backstage, and in the field, giving viewers rare access to intimate creative spaces and inspiring moments of realization.Artists imagine futures, wrestle with conflicts, and offer alternative ways of seeing ourselves and the world around us. Directed by some of Canada's most innovative voices in documentary film and shot with a mix of hand-held vérité and cinematic visuals, IN THE MAKING explores what it means to move through the world as an artist today.The subjects of the first season include: Lido Pimienta recording her new album in Colombia; Dana Michel performing at the Venice Biennale; Adrian Stimson facing historical trauma with AA Bronson on Siksika Nation in Alberta; Crystal Pite saying goodbye to a masterwork in Los Angeles; Shelley Niro publishing her life's work in Germany; Curtis Talwst Santiago reframing histories in Portugal and New York; Divya Mehra challenging colonial legacies in Winnipeg and Delhi, India; and Chilly Gonzales beginning a new chapter in Paris.A CBC original series produced by White Pine Pictures, IN THE MAKING is created by Sean O'Neill, Peter Raymont and Nancy Lang and produced by Sean O'Neill and Michelle Mama."
