As the first part of the series focuses on the fun and messiness of their relationship and dating lives outside the home, the series takes a more serious turn towards the end as things once again, get complicated between the two. Without spoiling the end of what's already a bite-size series, it's safe to say that dating is hard when you're already in a relationship.",
