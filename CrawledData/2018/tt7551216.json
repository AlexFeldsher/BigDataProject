            "Jonah Mulray is a professor whose world comes crashing down when his wife is killed in a car crash in Hong Kong. Though his wife lived and worked there for six months, Jonah's fear of flying has stopped him from ever visiting. Now forced to abandoned his sheltered life, he must venture across the world to identify her body. However, once he arrives he finds out a shocking truth and is drawn deeper in a web of conspiracy in a foreign and unfamiliar place.::Jan",
            "Strangers follows Professor Jonah Mulray, who receives a devastating international phone call about the death of his wife, Megan, who has been working in Hong Kong. He's poleaxed with grief, but has to galvanise himself to board a plane for Asia to identify his beloved wife's body. Megan has died in a car accident on the beautiful mountain roads at the top of Tai Po overlooking Hong Kong, and although a notorious black-spot, Jonah feels he must unravel the circumstances of her death following an emotional voicemail left by his wife just seconds before her death. With the help of Sally Porter from the British Consulate, Jonah is taken to the mortuary and in the saddest of surroundings he realises his wife has gone forever. Heartbroken Jonah is interviewed by Hong Kong detectives Daniel Tsang, Felix Chang and Wilfred Chow about Megan's death, but frustratingly they appear to be going through the motions. Is there more to the police investigation than the officers are revealing?::ahmetkozan",
            "Professor Jonah Mulray (Martin Freeman)'s life is turned upside-down when his wife, Megan (Dervla Kirwan), is killed in a car crash in Hong Kong. Although she lived and worked there half her life, Jonah has never been. He lives a small, sheltered life, and his fear of flying has kept him in London. But now he has no choice but to travel to the other side of the world to identify the body of the woman he loved.[1] Not long after arriving in Hong Kong, Jonah makes a shocking discovery about his wife. Jonah is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of conspiracy as he comes to terms with this utterly alien and unfamiliar environment, battling to uncover the truth about his wife's death.::ahmetkozan"
