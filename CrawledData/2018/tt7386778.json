            "SWITCH, a drama series based on a true story, follows a group of women working in the BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadism/Submission, Masochism) industry as they navigate leading a double life, the struggle for power, identity, sexuality, ambition, trauma, love and family. The series explores human nature, toxic masculinity, the hypocrisy in today's world, and the extremes people will go to in order to disguise who they truly are and fit in.Season 1 follows Stella (Stavroula Toska), a broken woman with a dark past who begins training as a dominatrix at Athena's Temple, aka The Temp, New York's most exclusive BDSM Establishment. Through her eyes we are introduced to the women and men who inhabit this underground world, one of whom is Elizabeth (Olympia Dukakis), the woman who built an empire out of the BDSM industry and who will soon change the course of Stella's life.Creator and star Stavroula Toska infiltrated Manhattan's most exclusive BDSM Dungeon in order to explore the aspects of BDSM most people don't talk about; the day-to-day running of a Dungeon business, the hiring, firing and training process of the women who work as dominatrixes and the clients (mostly men) who visit them every single day looking to escape their reality, make peace with their demons, heal their traumas, role-play their most secret fantasies, receive punishment for misbehaving and reveal themselves at their most vulnerable. This experiment was meant to last two weeks....what Toska didn't know at the time was that she'd end up getting sucked down a rabbit hole and have the future of an underground multi-million dollar empire lying at her feet.Please note: Names and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals.The mind-blowing season 1 is now available on line at switchtheseries.com"
