The people interviewed for the series moved to the United States from Mexico and Pakistan, Bangladesh and France, India, Brazil, Iraq, Canada, Ethiopia and more. While the mainstream narrative surrounding immigration can often be politically-charged and a constant source of angst, WE THE PEOPLE explores the positively refreshing and unapologetically real aspects of what it means to be a new immigrant in America today. The United States, throughout its history, has benefited greatly from the arrival of new people who bring with them fresh ideas, energy and ambition, but that legacy is in danger today. There is an urgent need for a different, more positive conversation and this series aims to facilitate that.",
