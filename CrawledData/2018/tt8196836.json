Photo Number 6 is not a standard travel program showcasing the obvious tourist attractions a location has to offer. In every episode host Alan Fletcher will be seeking out 5 travel experiences that go beyond the tourist guidebook and delves into the heart and soul of the places he visits. He takes viewers 'under the surface' and explores the culture, the politics, the landscape and the humanity of the places he visits. Through five fast paced cinematic segments Alan and director Stig Wemyss will take the audience on a quirky, humorous, dramatic and, occasionally, risky ride into fascinating and exciting destinations and rendezvous. The challenge in the show is to photograph each experience looking to choose just one photo that sums up the experience. Then, Alan and Stig will battle it out in the in-studio Red Room seeking the perfect shot worthy of the title Photo Number 6.",

            "_Photo Number 6_ (qv) combines the adventure of travel with the joy of photography. Host Alan Fletcher explores the world looking for that elusive photographic image that totally encapsulates the emotion, geography and human connections he makes.",
            "Travel is more than just getting off the bus and taking a few snaps. _Photo Number 6_ (qv) is not a standard travel program showcasing the obvious tourist attractions a location has to offer. In every episode host Alan Fletcher will be seeking out 5 travel experiences that go beyond the tourist guidebook and delves into the heart and soul of the places he visits. He takes viewers 'under the surface' and explores the culture, the politics, the landscape and the humanity of the places he visits. Through five fast paced cinematic segments Alan and director Stig Wemyss will take the audience on a quirky, humorous, dramatic and, occasionally, risky ride into fascinating and exciting destinations and rendezvous. The challenge in the show is to photograph each experience looking to choose just one photo that sums up the experience. Then, Alan and Stig will battle it out in the in-studio Red Room seeking the perfect shot worthy of the title _Photo Number 6_ (qv)."
