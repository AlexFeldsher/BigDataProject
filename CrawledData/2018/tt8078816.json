She's been dumped by a man many times because of her clumsy, reckless, and foolish behavior. And again, a man she wanted to marry dumps her for the worst reason ever: that she's like bland, tasteless devil's-tongue jelly, which means she's not attractive at all as a woman. Just then, Joon Heeappears before her with a broad smile on his face. He's as refreshing as a soft drink. Joon Hee is Jin Ah's childhood best friend's younger brother, who used to live next door. Jin Ah has always remembered him as a little kid, but one day, he comes back as a really masculine man. When she is surprised by his change, her gut feeling tells her that she would truly fall in love this time.",
