Ever since and wherever she goes, she has turned things upside down. Oda Upside Down has invented a magical zapper, charged with imagination - and if a shot of imagination hits you, it truly becomes hard not to look at things a little bit upside down. And Oda's zapper will be needed. As Oda arrives and parks her big bouncy camping-ball in a small, ordinary town, she quickly realizes that the town's self-appointed leader of Black Group, the kindergarten teacher Balder, rules over the children with all kinds of rules and regulations, and raised warning fingers. When Balder even manages to persuade the parents to enforce his rules and regulations at home, things truly begin to look bad.
