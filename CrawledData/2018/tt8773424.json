Adam is an over-confident player who is an aspiring model seeking to launch his career after witnessing a horrific construction accident on the job. Catrina, a bubbly aspiring singer, is on a mission to become the next Beyoncé after being cheated on by her long term boyfriend. Alex -- who joined the show in an attempt to turn over a new leaf -- must try to keep her pugnacious, hot tempered personality under control as she is tested by her new housemates. Brandon is socially inept and has an off-putting infatuation with his pet tarantula, Velvet. His mother urged him to join the show to improve his social skills. Lastly, Bria is a wealthy, glamorous socialite who came on the show to flaunt her high class status. Will these five bold personalities find a way to coexist?",
