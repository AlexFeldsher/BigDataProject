Where once there was green grass and trimmed trees, there are now fledgling forests beginning to reclaim the buildings around them. Where once there were shopping malls filled with eager people looking for that elusive bargain, there are now fortified and functional communities of people filled with hope that they can, together, rebuild this broken world and change things for the better. This series focuses on one of these communities, it's people, and the world around them. Each episode will feature a stand alone story told from the perspective of a few of these characters as they live out their day and overcome the obstacles in their way. In the process they will learn something about the world they live in and how it got to be the way it is, and also something about themselves and the impact they have on those around them.",
