It follows the life and times of an urban, bilingual, environmentally conscious left-wing couple in their thirties: Aino, who's originally from Finnish Lapland, and Swedish-speaking Micke. They are forced to move to an upper-class neighborhood, into an apartment owned by Micke's wealthy parents, who also live next door. In addition to Micke's parents, his childhood friend lives in the same building. When Aino's yokel brother moves into their guest room, people from all walks of life meet under the same roof: thirty-somethings and their parents, different family cultures, country people and urban people, north and south, Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking people, middle class people and blue-collar workers, right-wingers and left-wingers, childhood friends who have lost touch, and first and foremost, a couple who are still getting to know each other. Aino and Micke have a good relationship - but in every episode it'll be very much tested.",

They are forced to move to an upper-class neighborhood, into an apartment owned by Micke's wealthy parents, who also live next door. In addition to Micke's parents, his childhood friend lives in the same building. When Aino's yokel brother moves into their guest room, people from all walks of life meet under the same roof: thirty-somethings and their parents, different family cultures, country people and urban people, north and south, Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking people, middle class people and blue-collar workers, right-wingers and left-wingers, childhood friends who have lost touch, and first and foremost, a couple who are still getting to know each other. Aino and Micke have a good relationship - but in every episode it'll be very much tested."
