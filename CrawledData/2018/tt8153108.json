For the first two rounds, the bachelorette does not get to actually see the bachelors and must eliminate one, in the final round she eliminates one more only to be faced with a twist of the Percentage Calculator (compatibility meter) which tells her if the numbers agree. She then has the option to change her decision and either pick one of our last two finalists or bring back the first bachelor she eliminated sight unseen.
