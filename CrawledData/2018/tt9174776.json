On the last day, they create and serve a menu together that reflects and is inspired by their shared experiences, but also differences, surrounding food and culinary techniques. The menu is served and enjoyed by a small and exclusive group of guests in one of the chefs' local restaurants. The heart of the series builds on the chefs' tremendous skills, huge passion and curiosity for food, and their open mind and drive to never stop exploring and pushing their culinary boundaries. This is a documentary with no competition or conflicts whatsoever. Instead the episodes focus on how two chefs inspire each other to create something new and unexpected with tremendous flavors and compositions.",
