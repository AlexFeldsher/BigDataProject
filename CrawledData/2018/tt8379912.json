But despite the promise of fortune that fame has brought her, Celina decided to keep her identity a secret. Adele, her mother, made it very clear that she did not want her only child to pursue a career in music. Adele, who was born to a very poor family, sought luck through a singing contest on TV in the late 1990s. But controversies made her turn her back from show business. With no career, no money, and a child to raise, Adele was forced to work as a house help. Her first employer happened to be the Canadian Ambassador to the Philippines who had a Filipino wife and a music-loving son, Elton. Elton felt a connection with Celina early on. But when the Ambassador's duty in the Philippines came to an end, Celina was left behind by her childhood friend. Elton meanwhile pursued show business in Canada and became a pop sensation. One day, he came across a video of the Guitar Princess and instantly became a fan. When he had the opportunity to go back to the Philippines, he looked for Guitar Princess. But her anonymity was a hindrance. Justin, the son of Adele's recent employer, is protecting Celina's identity. He is also the brains behind Guitar Princess's persona and is secretly in love with her. He understood Celina's struggles and wanted to make her happy and fulfill her dreams of becoming a singer and finding her father through music. But for Taylor and Kate, US-based fashion and lifestyle vloggers and sisters of Justin, Elton is their dream guy. The moment they set foot in their family's home was the start of another period of misery for Celina. Listen to the melody of love of My Guitar Princess and find out whether Elton and Celina's love affair have a happy ending or will Justin be able to claim her love?",
