        "plot outline": "Audiences from around the world are about to get an inside look into an existence that is rarely exposed: The lives of women pastors. A new reality show, Women Pastors - Ladies in the Pulpit, is in post production. It features several real-life women in ministry as they share their stories of commitment, sacrifice and joy. Some of our cast members include Dr. Ane Mercer; Evangelist Beverly Broadus-Green and Pastor Deborah Powell. Our roster of recurring guests will include ordained Min. Fran Capo, Dr. Tamera Thomas and a myriad of entertainers. The show will be pitched to national networks for in September 2012. Oftentimes women pastors are wives, mothers and community leaders who shoulder the burdens of an entire congregation. They lead church groups, host events and are the spiritual leaders of a multi-generational congregation. In addition to church responsibilities, women pastors are involved in community events and family life. Do they meet expectations? You be the judge. Women Pastors - Ladies in the Pulpit exposes just how much responsibility is involved in being an effective spiritual leader in an increasingly negative world. It also reveals the dynamics of pulpit couples and the effort it takes to maintain those relationships in the spotlight. This series will empower others in search of a blueprint for their own lives while encouraging women to become leaders in their own families and communities. Although the show is appropriate for all ages, women in search of positive Christian role models will use this program in enhance their spiritual growth. Although the show is appropriate for all ages, married couples in search of positive Christian role models will use this program in enhance their spiritual growth.
