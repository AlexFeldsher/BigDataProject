Riles, the trouble-making, slacking, cold-hearted dimwit is known for getting himself or the rest of the world for that matter, in outrageous situations. He only cares about a few things. Money, McDonalds, and Porn. Drew is your average computer-savvy tech geek who is pretty much never willing to listen to people's rubbish. He's not cynical, he just sees that a lot of the world is bad, and he's just used to it. Then there's Tyler, the overly happy, extravagant, outgoing personality. Tyler always seems to be happy and isn't exactly \"exposed\" to some of the bad things in the world. He's very sheltered, and also acts as the ..glue...? to hold the three of the guys together since Drew and Riles wouldn't exactly get along if it was just the two of them. The three boys attend Shallow Waters High School. The school janitor Darnell, is a ghetto, pot smoker who almost never does his actual job.",
