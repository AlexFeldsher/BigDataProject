This mysterious woman's timing couldn't have been any worse. Kenny has been on a mission to reclaim his life and get the woman of his dreams, his wife Janae Jackson to marry him again after his last betrayal. Kenneth's secrets and lies have torn his marriage with Janae to pieces once. Will Janae Jackson, the successful defense attorney, be able to look beyond her husband's past and restore their once promising future together? Or will another UN-turned stone destroy their marriage for good? Hope may not be the most dangerous thing a person can possess after all. Maybe love is - Terrence and Joseline Dawson are the picture-perfect couple on the outside. Pastors of the largest church in the city and a superstar singer their lives seems to be one to admire. If the public only knew the truth about what really happens behind closed doors. The loss of a child has torn this family apart.",
