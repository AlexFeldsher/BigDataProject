Because of this, they get into a huge argument that forces Bradley out of the house, who leaves behind his personal belongings and house keys. He finds himself at a park and belts out a Shakespearean monologue out of frustration, when suddenly, Emile, a washed out and unsuccessful producer starts clapping in awe after hearing Bradley's performance. Emile offers her managerial services to him and willingly invites Bradley to star in a play that she is putting together. Bradley hesitantly accepts the offer and begins to work with Emile.",
