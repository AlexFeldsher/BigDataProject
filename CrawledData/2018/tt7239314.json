Each 2 minute episode will focus on one child as they show and tell what they're passionate about. The children are diverse yet they all have something in common...they LOVE something so much, they just want to show it off. Children will be profiled who are passionate, honest and authentic. Sometimes funny, sometimes shy, sometimes even a little bit emotional. The viewer will feel honoured to watch as each child takes us through their personal journey as they finish the statement...\"I LOVE...\"",
