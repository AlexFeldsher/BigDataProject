The revered sense of history-in-the-making is reduced to an endless string of human error. This group is by no means fit for space travel. As they slowly undermine each other - and the mission, the cowardly heroes have second thoughts. But there is no exit clause: they just have to bite the dust, put their diapers on and get ready to fly on their one-way trip to the outskirts of our solar system. MARS MELLOW transforms mankind's glorious quest to an exposé of humankind's flaws and space will never be quite as prestigious again.",
