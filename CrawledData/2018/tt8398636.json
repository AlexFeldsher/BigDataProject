Successful and direct, Allison is somehow just as clueless as Clementine. She's killing it at her job despite office sexism, but feels unsure about being single in her late 20s and decidedly unsure about how to change that. In these 10 minute episodes these women help each other through awkward encounters with peers and love interests, offering perspectives from both sides of the millennial divide. Together, they find a respect and loyalty that neither has experienced before.",
