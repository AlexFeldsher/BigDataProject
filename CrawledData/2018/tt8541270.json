Until you wake up one day and figure out that usually, it does not work that way. As do Nele an Gianni. Both around 40 (which is the new 30). Married for 10 years. Happily ever after - not really. Sure, they love each other, but their love life seems to have died a slow, sexless death. When Nele starts flirting with a stranger on a dating site and that turns out to be none other than Gianni, they plant their butts on a therapist's couch and start spicing up their sex life - at least that's the plan. Better leave your preconceptions at the bedroom door, 'cause this darkly funny series is not at all afraid to break a couple of eggs and a few taboos.",
