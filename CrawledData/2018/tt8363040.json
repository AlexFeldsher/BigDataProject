In the pub with snide rival Liam he meets and sleeps with the flirtatious Selina but she turns out to be a juror at Caroline's murder trial. However he also discovers evidence that discredits Liam and helps Caroline win her case, putting one over on smug prosecutor Ashley. This does not prevent his being mugged by a 'grateful' client.
