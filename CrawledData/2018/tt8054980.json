Each rose ceremony has contestants giving roses to 'save' another person from being eliminated and not finding love in paradise. There is always an uneven number of men and women, with a number of Bachelors and Bachelorettes being introduced each week, so there is always someone eliminated. The show is based on love and many dramas unfold because of some heated arguments as a result of contestant's feelings being put to the test.    "
