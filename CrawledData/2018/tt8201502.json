            "It's 1994 in Mexico City, and Alejandro Falco is a good policeman with a promising future and a young family. However, his perfect world is shattered when he is shot by a mysterious attacker in the line of duty. With a bullet lodged in his head, Falco falls into a coma - for the next 24 years. He awakes in 2018 with no memory of what happened, and to a world he doesn't recognize - including the internet and mobile phones! But far more devastating is the news that his wife has remarried, and the baby daughter he once knew is now a grown woman.The only thing he has left is his job, and Falco must find a way to start again and rebuild his life. But he just can't let it go; he has lost too much to not try and find out who did this to him. One way or another, he is going to get answers - and when he does, someone is going to pay. Produced by Spiral International and Dynamo (\"Narcos\"), Michel Brown, star of the International Emmy® award winning series \"Sr. Ávila\", has been cast in the lead role.The series is show-run and directed by acclaimed Mexican filmmaker, director and screenwriter Ernesto Contreras (Blue Eyelids, I Dream in Another Language, The Obscure Spring, and El Chapo for Netflix), who has a total of 19 International Film Festival Wins and 9 Nominations.\nErnesto Contreras said: \"'FALCO' will be an exciting cinematic experience across all episodes, where we will establish an expressive and stylized language, including the nostalgic element of the nineties (when Falco practically ceases to exist), and where the primary objective will be to create a special visual, audible, and emotional universe, to tell our story.\""
