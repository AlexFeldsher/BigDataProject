            "The Spanish Empire begins to become a memory of the past. The city of Seville, which for a long time was a strategic enclave for Europe because of its access by the Guadalquivir River to the lands of America, begins to decline. The old feudal order breaks down and in the middle of the sixteenth century the transition to the Renaissance and the bourgeoisie shakes the pillars that governed the Western world for ten centuries. The plague ravages Europe and Spain is not spared. Hospitals can not cope, brothels are increasingly monitored and convents less. In the homes of the nobles, the only thing that prevails is hedonism and seizing power. In the midst of an atmosphere suffocated by mistrust and betrayals on the order of the day, Matthew will have to find out who is the author of a series of diabolical crimes committed against the high places of Sevillian society. Otherwise, he will not find the forgiveness of the Holy Office and the Inquisition will decide to bias his life."
