The more attention grabbing news would be pushed \"above the fold' while the content deemed less important would be placed below, where is was mostly invisible when displayed on a newsstand. While newsstands are about as significant as phone booths these days, major media outlets still promote which stories they think will get the most attention (i.e. clicks and views). And with the ongoing Trump show, the clickbait seems to be writing itself keeping nuanced news that affects education, healthcare and civil rights out of the headlines. \"Below the Fold\" breaks down those stories. Covering current topics that don't get the attention they deserve in new playful ways. From satirical sketches, to pithy blogs to interviews in the field, Below the Fold blends comedy with progressive politics to bring you weekly ADD-approved videos that educate and entertain.",
