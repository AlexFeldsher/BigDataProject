A comedy, the story revolves around the life of Aditya, a newly married man who must balance his life as a lingerie salesman, while trying to hide the nature of his work from his wife and the prying eyes of his mother-in-law. Headlined by the superstars of Marathi cinema and television, Aniket Vishwasrao, Tejashri Pradhan, Kishori Ambiye and Saksham Kulkarni, 'Padded ki Pushup' is produced by Hungama Digital Media and CafeMarathi, and directed by Akash Gursale. When Aditya (Aniket Vishwasrao), a middle-class man marries Swara (Tejashri Pradhan), a rich girl, little does he know that he is actually tying the knot with his mother-in-law's snooping eyes as well. Already upset about her daughter eloping with Aditya and marrying against her wishes, Mangala (Kishori Ambiye) makes it her mission to meddle with her son-in-law's life to hilarious effect. Unemployed and wanting to prove that he can hold a permanent job, Aditya gets hired as a salesman to sell lingerie - something that he knows nothing about. From depending on the ill-fitting advice of his best friend, Sunny (Saksham Kulkarni), to taking a practical test in a bid to understand lingerie sizes and relying on the Internet for making him a lingerie expert - Aditya must now use every tool available to succeed at work and yet, somehow keep it a secret from his wife. His mom-in-law's suspicion about his job and her resolve to catch him adds to the comic dizziness that is his life.",
