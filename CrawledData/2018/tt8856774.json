Just as the mysterious, ever-present people known as \"The Common.\" This is the 80s that never was, and it is brought to life thanks to the \"Tales From The Loop\" RPG system and writer, Cameron Rice, as a mastermind GM. With episodes performed live on Hyper RPG's Twitch [Power Ranger's Hyperforce, Pencils and Parsecs] every Tuesday at 7pm PM, the story unfolds every week as not only the players make in the moment decisions, the audience can contribute to the world by adding problems, luck, and perhaps a vision or two. This unique platform offers an engaging viewing experience, promising on the spot storytelling that never disappoints.",
