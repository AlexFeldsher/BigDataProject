Fortunately, you can always count on your favorite super-hero who won't save your life but triggers your own imagination instead. And after all, having a family is one of the greatest things on earth! \"Casparade\" is the story of a family, which looks average and \"normal\" from the outside, but in fact celebrates craziness in everyday life. It is a warmhearted and funny TV series for kids with an optimistic message enforcing positive values.",
