Minecraft has been a part of YouTube for so long, and become such a huge part of the community that I have to admit, it's kind of sad to see it go. It's a pretty good game that I have a lot of nostalgia for, but at this point that's it. Nostalgia. It had a really good run, with a big impact on the gaming and online community.    "
