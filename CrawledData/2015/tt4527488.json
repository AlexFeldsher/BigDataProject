            "Garage Dreams captures the mosaic of modern auto culture in an engaging human story driven format. Its not so much the horsepower of interest here but more the people behind these beautiful machines. The inclusive stories celebrate passion, authenticity and human spirit and so appeal to a broader general entertainment audience than performance based car shows.Each episode comprises unique and compelling personal tales about a special car or bike project and provides a window into the sub-culture of these aficionados. The series examines in beautiful detail the gritty streets of South Central Los Angeles, the emerging bike building collectives in Asia and is anchored by the progressive scene around Melbourne, the auto culture capital of Australia.Style cues, inspirations, fashion, music and film are readily explored as we get deeper into these biographical accounts. Designed to reflect on the traditions of the hand-crafted workshop movement and also speak to the new-age collector set, this series is positioned to appeal to the selective auto culture audience that is rapidly defining a global mainstream lifestyle."
