No longer innocent and cherubic, this Cupid is sarcastic, hostile and disheartened, but he recognises something in Ben that he hesitantly welcomes and they embark on a weird and whimsical journey. Unceremoniously replaced as the harbinger of love, the mysterious Cupid is self-admittedly rusty and unpractised and Ben's initial series of dates are disastrous and hopeless. Yet these are, on hindsight, a part of the wise and wily Cupid's plans and when Ben is about to quit in comes the beautiful, warm and surprising Lucy (Lauren Wigmore). As Ben has always done, he readily confides his thoughts and feelings to his best friend and girl next door; the insightful, sensitive and funny Kayleigh (Shelley Davenport) and just as things are looking to improve in his love life Ben realises his feelings for Kayleigh might be more than just platonic.",
