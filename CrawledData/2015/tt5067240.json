He rapidly works his way up and builds a loyal following of the most brutal men in Germany. Capitalising from the broken state of Germany post WWI Hitler sets about his revolution. The infamous Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 was superficially a failure which saw Hitler arrested, imprisoned and silenced from speaking. But this was only the beginning of a reign of terror.    "

The devastating mix of propaganda and unbridled terror caused the German nation to fall under his spell, seemingly oblivious to the racial hatred being doled. WWII loomed, the manufacture of weapons meant unemployment was a thing of the past and the economy bloomed and so Nazi popularity would soar.    "
