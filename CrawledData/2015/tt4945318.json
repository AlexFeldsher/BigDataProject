Coral reefs line thousands of tranquil atolls, while relentless waves batter rocky cliffs on other shores. In Papua, the mountains reach so high that permanent ice caps top their peaks, surrounded by barren alpine tundra. These wildly ranging habitats are home to an incredible number and diversity of living creatures - this iconic and landmark series is a celebration of Indonesia's most spectacular locations and incredible wildlife.",
