An opportunity to paint a portrait of real friends and the experiences and memories they shared. Follow a group of friends, whose every move over a 5 year period of time has been captured on a flip cam. The good, the bad, and the ugly. This docu-series breaks the mold of the typical \"reality\" television show. It's Friends meets America's Funniest Home Video's meets The Real World. It's the most authentic reality show ever produced, because it wasn't \"produced.\"",
