            "Human trafficking, forced prostitution, modern slavery, money laundering, tax fraud the statistics about organized crime in Europe are dizzying.A few years ago, a new era dawned for European policing when most European countries joined a treaty of police co-operation preventing and fighting organized international crime by setting up small and flexible cross-border units, so-called Joint Investigation Teams (JIT). These Teams are able to operate quickly and unbureaucratically and are authorized to take over and lead investigations.In THE TEAM the story of one of these European JITs is told: Harald Bjørn (Lars Mikkelsen) from Denmark, Jackie Mueller (Jasmin Gerat) from Germany and Alicia Verbeek (Veerle Beatens) from Belgium, as they unravel an unscrupulous criminal organization in Europe. Their work is not devoid of personal cost. Old wounds are ripped up. New wounds are caused. In their investigation they often find themselves staring into an abyss of death and destruction. But that is also where they find the truth. And their friendship.A murdered woman is found in Copenhagen. Killed with a shot through her left eye and one of her fingers cut off. Only hours later, two other murdered women are found in Antwerp and Berlin. Again shot through the left eye and a finger cut off.For Harald, Jackie and Alicia, the Belgian journalist Jean Louis Poquelin (Carlos Leal) becomes the prime suspect as he visited all three victims just before they were killed.And it seems hes planning to continue killing. But when a fourth woman is found shot to death and Jean Louis is kidnapped, the case takes on a whole new direction. The track leads back to the Film Festival of Cannes six years ago. And to a criminal organization which has branched out to many European countries when it comes to human trafficking, illegal migration, prostitution, bribery and corruption an extremely successful multinational concern with many employees and piles of dead bodies and shattered destinies in its wake.The head of this organization is the Lithuanian billionaire Marius Loukauskis (Nicholas Ofczarek). An unheard talent at reading the market and creating new opportunities. Loukauskis is close to being legally untouchable not least due to his now huge financial possessions in the legal business world and his well known generosity to the establishment. A classic combination of formal and informal economics.The investigation leads THE TEAM across Europe, from Berlin to Copenhagen, from Antwerp to The Hague up to the Austrian Alps and over to Lithuania and reveals how organized crime cuts through and affects all layers of society. But, most of all, the fates of relatives and the victims of crime.To Harald, Jackie and Alicia justice is to give back the victims their dignity.\n"
