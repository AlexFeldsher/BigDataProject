And they have much more chances to adopt the boy than lonely and not so successful Nastya. One more problem: some joker starts calling her with strange childish rhymes: \"Din-don, din-don, We are playing kingdom\". All this brings the heroine to desperation. But suddenly she gets an unexpected gift from destiny - a big and expensive order, a construction of social settlement \"Sokoliki\" for poor families. Wondering why a well-known contractor Zotov chose her seedy firm, Nastya gladly starts the work. She hopes to improve her financial position and get a chance to adopt Danya.",
