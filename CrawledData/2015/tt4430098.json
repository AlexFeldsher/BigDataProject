            "The dream of having a child. The decision never imagined ... The priceless family gained!\nFor millions of women, the path to creating a healthy baby comes with a choice they never imagined: accepting the end of their own genetic lineage and relying on another woman's donated egg.\nEgg donation allows for a life-making possibility, it is a timely topic and it is controversial. The decisions around it are delicate and difficult, yet it is redefining what it means to be a modern family.\nEGG FACTOR is a groundbreaking and gripping new series that follows the fascinating lives of people involved in creating families with donated eggs.\nIn the series, hopeful parents who have struggled to conceive are finally able to realize their dream of creating a baby because of healthy eggs from young women who willingly go through the grueling egg retrieval process. The Journeys are both extraordinary and entertaining as the donors, too, have their own dreams and dilemmas. The lives of these different women are explored intimately as they intertwine in a complex and compelling tale, one with the most wondrous result: a new life.\nIn EGG FACTOR, the donations are arranged by Gifted Journeys, a leading egg donation and surrogacy agency headed by Wendie and Tina. The two are dynamic, engaged, and empathetic; they know intimately what their clients are experiencing, as they have both been egg donors multiple times. Doctor Vic Sahakian of the Pacific Fertility Center in Los Angeles is the guide on the medical side. He's pioneering, straight-talking, and he makes new life happen.\nEach episode of EGG FACTOR introduces a new set of hopeful parents with their donor candidates and traces their remarkable journey to a beloved baby. Each story is authentic and moving , and no story is ever the same..."
