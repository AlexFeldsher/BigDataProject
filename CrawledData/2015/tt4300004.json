        "plot outline": "Cordell Broadus is a high school football player who has it all: size, speed, strength and a natural ability to \"straight ball\". The junior wide receiver is one of the most sought after recruits in the Nation. Schools from Notre Dame to USC to even Harvard have made offers. He's an honors student with a thousand watt smile, seemingly made for stardom. He knows the limelight well, as the son of an entertainment icon...Snoop Dogg. Football is more than a game to Snoop. It represents a dream. The streets robbed Snoop of a football scholarship to a major university. In Cordell, he saw another chance. Since Cordell could put one foot in front of the other, Snoop has been grooming his boy for the game. Like Archie Manning, he constantly filmed his son playing ball in the backyard. Snoop created a youth football league and coached Cordell's Pop Warner team. Currently, Snoop is a constant presence in Cordell's football life. He's a regular attendee at practice, and is in constant contact with Cordell's head coach. When Snoop can't attend a game, he has it streamed to him, no matter where he is in the world. Snoop Dogg is an international pop culture icon that consistently attracts mainstream media attention. Yet, it is Snoop's dream to one day be better known as the Dad of Cordell Broadus. Snoop and Son: A Dad's Dream will provide an exclusive behind the scenes look as Snoop and Cordell prepare for the next level. We'll be in the Boradus home for family dinners; on Snoop's tour bus as he breaks down game film; and on the sidelines for each game of Cordell's senior season. The journey begins in Spring 2014 as Snoop and son hit the camp circuit, and will conclude with signing day in February 2015. As a documentary series, Snoop and Son: A Dad's Dream will offer an unprecedented look at an entertainment icon, his football star son and their journey together.",
