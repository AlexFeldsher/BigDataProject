The Geraghty Brothers are the embodiment of the disillusionment that permeates Ireland today - abandoned and uncared for as children, they've survived on their wits alone throughout their direction-less lives. But things can only go so far before someone shouts stop and in his life Seamus has reached that point. With numerous failings in the past the one that rankles most with him is allowing his friend Paudie to take the fall for their shared transgression. And now, through Paudie's death Seamus has been offered the chance to redeem himself and take a stand, even if that means crossing lines and literally getting his hands dirty. In the tradition of comedy duos like Laurel and Hardy or Git Hynes and Bunny Kelly, Seamus and Martin bring genuine warmth and human touch to the dark story.",
