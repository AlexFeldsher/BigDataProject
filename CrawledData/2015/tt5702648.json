CITY: As she enters the city, her truck radio transitions from classical to hate. She arrives at Bobo's Place, exchanges pleasantries, and watches part of the underground cabaret. They conduct business: Bobo hands her the weapon and identifies the target. She drives downtown and picks up her mark. They stroll around and wind up in his apartment, where she dispatches him. Before leaving earth, she returns to Bobo's neighborhood and visits her sacred ones. She tells them not to be fearful, they are safe from harm.
