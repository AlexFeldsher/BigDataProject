Skye Scott and Mac Freeman are recently engaged, but Mac's years of commitment phobia may be a little too late and opened up some doors to Skye's past that is causing her to vacillate between the dark and darker sides. Roman Freeman, Mac's son, is a senior at ECSU. He is dating Sage Baxter, but his unsavory sexual appetite leads him to stray. Xavier Rey, owner of The French Quarters Luxury Resort, is an ECSU graduate. After graduation, he left Eden City with the woman of his dreams. She returned without him. He returned three years ago to not only build a business, but to rebuild the bridge that connects him to the woman that synchronizes his heart, mind and body.
