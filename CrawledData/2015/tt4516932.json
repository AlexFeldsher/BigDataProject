With his authentic Wastemobile equipped with an ingenious, custom-made, dumpster stove and always hungry for some used cooking oil, this amazing road trip will begin from Vienna's \"dirty\" little secrets to continue to Berlin's edible urban fruits and wild plants. From there, David will be off to the Netherlands to take a look into the future of nutrition, and then, he will visit the European Parliament in Belgium where almost 150kg out of 4000 meals served daily end up in the bin. Ultimately, the journey will conclude in Brittany to deal with the matter of the rejected by-catch while the race against food waste continues, underlining the fact that regardless of the nice initiatives, there is still a lot to be done.::Nick Riganas"
