Gabe solicits the assistance of colleague Amy Cole and his estranged cousin Nathan Parsons. Nathan Parsons is an aspiring business man who inherited an executive position from his father, Mike Parsons, CEO of Parsons Global. Gabe renews his relationship with Nathan as Gabe seeks new funding for his mysterious project. Nathan reluctantly agrees to allow the private transfer of funds. With the promised funding, he shifts his attention to the technical issues he cannot resolve himself. Amy, whose ambition to become more integrated in the physical science community, sees potential that attracts her to the project. Naturally, things don't go as planned and Gabe must find a balance between maintaining his relationships to his benefactors while remaining faithful to the secrecy and direction of the greater project. The questions that spawn from these moral and philosophical events and situations will have answers within postmodern themes and exotic images.",
