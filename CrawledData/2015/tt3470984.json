There's child abandonment, trespassing, and drunken fathers having Vietnam flashbacks. And there's just no easy way to explain to the emergency room nurse why you brought in an unconscious, half-naked woman in handcuffs. Each episode we meet a new woman and they're as diverse as the city in which this adult comedy is set - New York. Drenched in sexual energy, New York offers the most important factor to a one night stand - anonymity. But beware.
