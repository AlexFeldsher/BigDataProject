        "plot outline": "Juana Bravo is a young, single, attractive woman who, after being an accessory to a robbery, is forced to escape from the capital, taking her teen aged son Diego with her. The safest place for them to go is San Fermin, her hometown, about an hour away from the capital, where Juana finds not only a hiding place, but also reconnects with her past. This reconnection is personified by Ambrosio, her father and the mayor of San Fermin, with whom she had broken off relations fifteen years before. Soon Juana is going to discover that San Fermin, like many other small towns in Latin America, has become a sort of backyard to the capital and home to a large, unpopular, and undesired landfill. After saving a girl from a fire and becoming an unexpected heroine, Juana will be convinced that she can give something back to the welcoming community by working with her father on the city council. After a while, Juana will uncover a dark case of political corruption that directly involves her father and the powerful company that manages the town's landfill. This will lead her to become an inexperienced but convictional mayor, who courageously faces the various injustices that the town suffers. In the midst of enormous sacrifices to her personal life and family, Juana and her loyal team fight to mobilize the people and demand that central government put a stop to corruption. This conflict is coupled by her struggle to raise her son, who becomes more and more rebellious as the story unfolds, as well as dealing with a love triangle that forms between Juana, one of the town's police officers, and a former boyfriend from her youth.",
