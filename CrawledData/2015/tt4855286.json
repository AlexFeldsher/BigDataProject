            "The Ten Commandments is the first Brazilian soap opera based on a biblical story, with special effects and a thrilling story, produced by Rede Record. It retells one of the most famous passages of the Bible: Moses saga, from his birth to the arrival of his people to the Promised Land, escaping from Egypt through the Red Sea, and the encounter with God on Mount Sinai.Free adaptation of the books Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, the novel covers more than one hundred years of history and will have 150 chapters divided into four phases, with dozens of characters. In addition to the historical content, the novel The Ten Commandments will be filled with family conflict, intrigue, power struggles, betrayals, jealousy, hate, forbidden passions and impossible loves, stuffed in emotional plots.The novel begins in the city of Pi-Rameses, in Egypt, in 1300 B.C when the mighty Pharaoh Seti, who hates and despises the Jewish people, decrees death for all Israelite male babies. To the consternation of the enslaved people, many babies are thrown into the Nile. But one is saved by his family, which puts him in a basket of reeds, trusting that God will take you to a safe place.The basket down the Nile River and ends up in the hands of princess Henutmire, who has compassion for the child and saved his father's decree, Pharaoh Seti.Moses is raised as an Egyptian prince beside his uncle-brother, Ramses. The beautiful Nefertari will awaken his love, causing many conflicts. Knowing its origins, but finding himself abandoned by his Hebrew family, Moses finally discovers the truth that has been hidden for so many years and gets involved with the suffering of his people, falling out of favor with the pharaoh.Forced to flee, he goes to the land of Midian, where he marries the beautiful and rebellious Zipporah, and spends many years working as a shepherd. One day, with his flock, Moses receives a message from God, which is revealed to him and sends him back to Egypt to free his people from slavery.Upon returning to Egypt, Moses rediscovers his brothers, Aaron and Miriam, his mother, Jochebed, his father Amram, and faces that one day was like a brother and now become your worst enemy: Ramses. Having inherited the throne of Egypt, Ramses will do anything to prevent Moses to fulfills his mission.Only after his land be destroyed by the Ten Plagues and the death of his firstborn, Ramses allows the Jewish people out of Egypt. Still, he decides to pursue them through the desert. It is then that God, in one of the great moments of the Old Testament, opens the Red Sea - allowing the Jewish people to cross, and then closes it, killing the Egyptian army chasing them.In the desert, the Hebrews go through many adventures and challenges, always led by Moses, who will guide them over forty years until they reached the Promised Land. During this journey, characters and storylines will mix to the main story, creating an unprecedented epic novel, where the audience will see a people being forged, a nation being prepared and will follow the path of faith and courage of Moses and his people."
