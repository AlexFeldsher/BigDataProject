Amidst their dynamic and challenging workloads, serious drama reaches new heights in this backstage glimpse of the people who make television magic happen. Baek Sung Chan (Kim Soo Hyun) is a fresh new producer. He was a law graduate of an ivy-league school who now works in the variety department of KBS. He made the career switch after following in the footsteps of his first love, which didn't exactly work out for him. Although he is intelligent, he is also clumsy. As the new intern he has a lot to learn if he wants to succeed in the Korean entertainment industry. Tak Ye Jin (Gong Hyo Jin) is a hot-shot producer who gets things done her way. She has ten years of experience in the industry. She is smart and ambitious, but can be caustic in her criticism, as she doesn't sugarcoat her opinions. She is the director of the popular show \"Music Bank\". If Baek Sung Chan wants to succeed, he'll need outperform her expectations...or avoid Tak Ye Jin completely, neither of which will be easy tasks. Ra Joon Mo (Cha Tae Hyun), is a seasoned producer and director who has worked in the industry for ten years as well. Yet despite his immense experience and his contributions to numerous shows, he has yet to develop a single hit show that he can be proud to call his own. Chae Tae Hyun is a cast member on the real life variety show \"2 Days 1 Night\". His role as Ra Joon Mo in \"Producer\" will include a turn as a producer of \"2 Days 1 Night\". He is most well known for his lead role in international hit \"My Sassy Girl\" Cindy (IU), is a top-star and temperamental singer. She \"debuted\" as a child at the age of 13. Now at the young age of 23, she can actually be considered a veteran. She has the nickname \"Ice Princess\" for her coldness and lack",
