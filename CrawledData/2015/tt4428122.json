        "synopsis": [
            "The new recruits have just arrived at Quantico Base in Virginia and Special Agent Liam O'Connor (Dougray Scott) tells them that the FBI Academy is the toughest boot camp and hardest grad school rolled into one. The agent hopefuls include Bay Area beauty Alex Weaver (Priyanka Chopra), Brooklyn hipster Simon Asher (Tate Ellington), clean cut Mormon Eric Packer, golden boy Caleb Haas (Graham Rogers), southern belle Shelby Wyatt (Johanna Braddy), hijab wearing Nimah Anwar (Yasmine Al Massri), and good looking Ryan Booth (Jake McLaughlin) who manages to seduce Alex before classes begin. Some come from FBI families, others have been victims of terrorism. Whatever their reason for joining, these recruits only have a 50/50 chance of finishing and there are no second chances. Between target practice and tests of physical endurance, they have to learn the art of investigation. Their first exercise is to find secrets about their fellow trainees. This task proves to be very enlightening- exposing more than they would like. But it pushes one of the recruits tragically too far. This tragedy will reflect poorly on supervisor Liam and his friend and boss, Miranda Shaw (Aunjanue Ellis), the director of Quantico. But they're about to face something even bigger -a recruit is suspected of masterminding the biggest attack on New York City since 9/11. Smash showrunner Josh Safran writes and executive produces with Mark Gordon and Nick Pepper."
