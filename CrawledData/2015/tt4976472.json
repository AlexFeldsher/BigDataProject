            "Based on the 80's black comedy, Heathers (1988), and it's musical adaptation, Heathers: The Musical (2014), _The Veronica Exclusive_ (qv) is a modern twist on the old cult teen film.",
            "Veronica Sawyer is a high school senior who just wants one thing: to get through her last year of high school in one piece. Recording everything that happens to her and posting it on YouTube, she plans to fly under the radar as always. The Heathers, however, have other plans. The Heathers rule the school with a perfectly manicured fist, and Veronica finds herself swept up in their world of gossip, backstabbing, and cruel pranks directed at the lower caste of students - including Martha, Veronica's best friend. Veronica is deeply unhappy, but endures it for the sake of her social status. That is where Jane Dean comes in. Jane, or \"J.D.\", and Veronica fall for each other quickly, and J.D. promises Veronica that they can make the Heathers pay. But when the bodies start piling up, Veronica realizes she may have gotten in a bit over her head...::Susan Mesler-Evans",
            "Veronica Sawyer: Your classic, angst-ridden teen. She has spent the past three years of high school flying under the radar, invisible. She isn't unhappy with this, however, as she finds an outlet through vlogging her life on YouTube. Senior year, however, takes a turn for the beautiful when she somehow finds herself swept into the clutches of the Heathers. The Heathers, Westerburg High School's most powerful clique, rule the school with an iron manicure. They tear Veronica from the world of AP homework and movie nights and into the world of shopping and parties. Veronica, though at first in love with this beautiful new world she's been thrown into, eventually realizes that the love she feels when she's around the Heathers is only skin deep. She realizes that, in reality, the Heathers aren't the nicest of people and that at every turn she's surrounded by lies and backstabbing. Everyday is a war that she is tired of fighting. Eventually Veronica finds a haven from this high school hell in new girl Jane Dean. Jane Dean: Rebellious, dark, and clever. Veronica and Jane warm up to each other quickly, and together they fend their way through senior year. That is, however, until the Heathers come across Veronica's YouTube channel. The Heathers destroy Veronica for the world to see, leaving her and her channel a mockery. In an act of pure stupidity between Heather Chandler, Jane Dean, and Veronica, things take a turn for the deadly, leaving Veronica to wonder what she's gotten herself into..."
