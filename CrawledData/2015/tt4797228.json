        "synopsis": [
            "Disappearing is living a virtual existence. Technology has given us the ability to not be physically connected to anything. You can bank online, you can pay online and order things online. You dont have to physically go anywhere. Technology has really made it so we can live virtual. However, this all comes with a caveat, once a persons information is online, its available for everyone to see and use for their own purposes. This is where Frank Briggs comes in, he takes that information and places it in a hall of mirrors.Once you enter his digital hall of mirrors, your every Web inquiry, online deposit, social media post and email to Mom will take crazy, cockeyed turns from self-expression into misdirection until poof! you emerge months later a virtual individual with all the freedom of a newborn. What you do then is entirely up to you; this magic man has no intention of breaking the law by helping you forge a new identity. When life becomes too much, Frank Briggs can help you disappear.Despite he predilection for working in the shadows, Frank suffers from the same malady plaguing so many today, the need for recognition. Aiding him in this is Darby Shaffer, a talented young journalist for Philadelphia This Week, an alt-newspaper. In Frank, she sees the story that will elevate her career in a declining industry, but she also has another reason for covering Frank, as she hopes to find a way to hide her the demons from her past.Also aiding Frank is his long-time friend Milo Gephardt, a jack of all trades, master of none but knows the streets inside and out, maybe too well. Milo is a man who never got a break so he makes his own, rarely with a positive outcome. Each episode, these three character try to aid someone trying to disappear for one reason or another. Whether it be a woman try to elude her violent ex-lover, a young man who just won the lottery or an eye-witness of a violent crime. Each case mirrors something occurring in the lives of our protagonists and as the series progresses, we discover each character has their own hall of mirrors they want to escape from."
