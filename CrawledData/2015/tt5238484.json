Sougo Amagi is a young orphan in a mining town on Gift, a world where enchanting blue crystals lay deep in the earth below. Obsessed with the crystals, and annoyed by his classmates-wealthy Kaon, handsome Roman, and clever Otto-sougo ventures into the cavernous underground where he encounters Felia, a mysterious girl with blue hair, and a magical gift. Thus begins their adventure, and yours-if you fall as hard as we did for the catchy opening tune, and the rainbow-colored palette."
