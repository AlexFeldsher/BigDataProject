            "Around the World in 80 Tricks is a magic series that sees British born breakdancer turned magician Magical Bones showcase his unique brand of trickery on his version of an international stage, the streets of Europe and Asia.This episode sees Bones introduce his trademark fusion of street dance and magic to an unsuspecting public in France and Barcelona.In Paris, Bones is keen to make his mark in the homeland of the godfather of modern magic, Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin.Here the first trick he tries on a variety of people involves transforming pieces of paper into something priceless!He also becomes inspired to create a special gift for a couple in the \"City of Love\" so seeks out some newlyweds to perform an incredible and romantic card trick at the famous Lover's Bridge.With street magic there is no place to hide and in plain sight of the busy Notre Dam Cathedral, Bones repeatedly baffles people with his take on the classic Linking Rings trick. All he's using is a couple of rubber bands, but there's no easy way to figure out how he gets them to link and separate at will!In each episode Bones let's you in on a trick that you can try at home. This week he shows you how to do two different types of magic, an optical illusion and an impossible balancing act with coins.In Barcelona, Bones tries to match the amazing feats of the young acrobatic Castellers by performing a series of quick fire card tricks surrounded by crowds of kids.With Barcelona the home of football, he finds himself at the mercy of the silky skills of football freestylers but soon shows them an impossible ball trick.Here he takes his card trickery to the next level too, baffling a series of people by making the same card disappear from his hands only to appear not once, but twice in two completely different places!Bones also hits the beach where a group of young people scream in shock after he performs an incredible double trick. First he reads their mind and then he makes whatever they were thinking of come to life in their own hands!For the show's grand finale, Bones is taking on one of magic's most well known tricks by attempting to escape from a straitjacket. However, after being strapped and buckled in by two security guards in the middle of a busy square, Bones deliberately makes the trick even harder by breakdancing at the same time. So while trying to free himself, he's also spinning on his back. The moves may be slick but can he really pull off this unusual twist on a classic trick?"
