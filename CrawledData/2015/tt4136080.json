Today, Randolph is taking a leave of absence from the company to run as the Republican candidate for Mayor. Thinks the Tea Party is too liberal. Hasn't had sex with his wife in ten years... but is far from celibate. Wendell covets the success of his brother, Randolph, and never lets up on his dream of making legitimate, mainstream movies. Trapped in a frigid marriage, Wendell cannot help the love he feels for his sister-in-law, Janice. Randolph's son, KYLE, is the show's moral center - the only one who believes in the goodness of humanity. Wants to find his soul mate. Forced to work in the family business, but only agrees if they branch out into marijuana cigarettes. Kyle's life is turned upside down when he falls in love with a woman he meets - then loses - in an elevator. He goes back to the same spot every day, hoping she'll re-appear. Kyle's sister, LILLY, is a professional martyr, passionately \"anti-tobacco,\" and a habitual chain smoker. Her goal is to derail her father's company and bid for Mayor. That said, she really wants to be a movie star. Kyle's mother, JANICE, is having a torrid affair with her nephew, LOGAN.

Logan is firmly entrenched in the \"bottom 99%\" and wears his modest upbringing on his sleeve. Having an affair with his Aunt Janice. Moderately successful, part-time gigolo with no health insurance. Only wants to be rich. Will do anything to get there. Manipulative. Street smart. Wannabe. Wendell's wife and Kyle's stepmother, MARIE, is a former Miss Florida who solicits door-to-door for PEEA: People For the Ethical Euthanization of Animals - a dubious cartel of clothing manufacturers.
