There she meets fellow teacher Patrick (Jude Tshisevhe) and the pair are drawn together, not only by their love but also by their common vision for the school, their idealism and their genuine passion for the school and for the students. They are teachers who love teaching. Together, through the series, they face numerous challenges in the school ranging from a basic lack of resources, under-qualified teachers and an ever-changing curriculum to child-headed households, drugs and gangs to rape, a viral sex video and teenage pregnancies.
