Eight Zero One (pronounced \"Eight Oh One\" for locals) is the narrative series about Salt Lake City's coming-of-age. Each episode features a slice-of-life narrative story that takes place in a different neighborhood of Salt Lake City (i.e. the Avenues, Glendale, etc.) The stories define Salt Lake City as we know it best in order to intentionally direct our social and arts culture for the next decade.
