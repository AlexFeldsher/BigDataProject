            "An anime based on a novel based on a Vocaloid-based song. Catch all that? Mikagura High School is a boarding school where each student must join an activity club upon enrollment, and then battle it out with other club reps using their own unique abilities. Naive freshman Eruna Ichinomiya enters Mikagura High School with dreams of beauty and fun, but soon becomes the representative of a club, and is immediately thrown into the fray. However, Eruna soon finds out that in the culture clubs, there is one cardinal rule ... and she's going to have to learn it the hard way.",
            "From the studio behind \"Laughing Under the Clouds\" and \"Yuruyuri\" comes a high school fantasy unlike any other! Like most awkward teens, formerly reclusive gamer Eruna Ichinomiya struggle to find her place at Mikagura High School. But her experience is far from ordinary, as the mischief-making members of the school's manga, calligraphy, drama, and other cultural clubs vie for total school domination in a rather extreme way-ULTIMATE ATTACKS. Get ready for the high-energy high school adventure you've only ever dreamed of.",
