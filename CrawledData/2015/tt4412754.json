            "Denise Dobkin is a struggling, opportunistic independent columnist who escapes her debtors by accelerating her budding romance with well-heeled piano teacher Chris Schaefer. Yet, as she learns something very disturbing about Chris, she finds she may have discovered the scoop of a lifetime, a scoop that may cost the lives of many young women, including herself. Forced into participation with an increasing number of missing women, it soon becomes foggy which of the lovers is the true monster. However, Chris and Denise are shocked to learn they are not alone with their heinous secret, becoming pawns in the vicious designs of the most unassuming of neighbors. Meanwhile, a forensic specialist and freshly demoted sergeant fight with their own sexual demons in their fight against a fierce battle of inches to connect the dissonant dots between missing persons. It is a small world, and many young women disappear from it. Many things are often found in it too."
