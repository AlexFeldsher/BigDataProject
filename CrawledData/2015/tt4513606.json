So, like any passionate youth, she takes the first job she's offered: a less-than-ideal position aboard Space Alliance transport vessel, the HMS Janeway. She works hard, but no one seems to notice how totally baller she is. Until, that is, she is unexpectedly promoted. To captain. Of the whole ship. No big deal. So begins Space Happens, the tale of Captain Joy and her new ship, a ship which harbors a dark secret that threatens to destroy the universe. Will her crew of rejects and rebels help her save it? Or will they succumb to battles and bad guys, stresses and expectations? Little do they know that there is a force darker than their own failings, a force plotting their downfall.",
