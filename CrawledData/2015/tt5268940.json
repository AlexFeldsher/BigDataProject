            "Luminary art-critic Jed (John O'May) and his wife Iris (Marina Prior) have always lived their life together on their own terms - falling out of love and deciding to divorce will be no different. They are throwing a big bash at their vast country estate - a civilised, joyful announcement to their friends and the world that despite their long and satisfying marriage, they are starting afresh.The party to celebrate their \"conscious uncoupling\", is perfectly curated by Jed and Iris's soon to be unemployed P.A., the pretty and well-meaning Caroline (Kate Miller-Heidke). What Jed and Iris don't know, is that Caroline has spiralled into impossible debt and tonight is the night the loan sharks have come to make their claim - the money she owes - or her life.Iris's little sister Louise (Lisa McCune), near deafened by her biological clock after a series of failed relationships, anticipates a life with Jed once the divorce is final. But during the evening she finds herself irresistibly drawn to another.Iris's younger lover, William (Matthew McFarlane), is looking forward to spending more time with her, but instead has a life-changing encounter with Ellen that affects his future in more ways than one.Iris and Jed's closest friends, Ellen (Melissa Madden Gray) and Patrick (Peter Cousens), find the notion of celebrating a divorce callous. They reassure themselves that their own marriage is unwavering - until the events of the evening leave them both reeling.Toby (Hugh Sheridan) the waiter harbours ambitions to be a big name artist and is determined to attract the attention of the party's host. But Toby'd encounters with Jed have unexpected consequences.Jed and Iris's decision to divorce sets everyone off on unforeseen paths and as the evening unfolds, chaos and mayhem ensue. At the end of the party Jed and Iris make a confession to their guests after a night of revelations about history and love, mortality, friendship and destiny."
