In the 9th century, a young but powerful Norse explorer traverses an uncharted ocean to the farthest shores of a mysterious new world.

Little does the young explorer know, this new land is filled with cunning and formidable Natives, as well as a dark and evil force that threatens the lives of everyone. History reveals the Norse people as skilled explorers and warriors, with evidence suggesting they discovered North America long before another. What if during a time when the Northwest Passage was warm, these robust people traveled around Alaska and into the shores of the Pacific Northwest? What would they encounter during a time period when the Natives were thriving and strong?
