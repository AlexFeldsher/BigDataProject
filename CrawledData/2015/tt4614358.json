Despite their full-time, mind-numbingly insipid temp jobs, their crazy, trend-obsessed roommate, and the dicey community theatre they've committed themselves to, Kath and Ariel cling to the hope that someday they will create something beautiful. Bottom Little Theatre is a quick-paced mockumentary \"Waiting for Guffman\" styled web series that follows the earnest friends on their journey to realize their dreams with the hilarity, sincerity, and sometimes disillusionment that constitutes community theatre and its cast of eccentric characters.
