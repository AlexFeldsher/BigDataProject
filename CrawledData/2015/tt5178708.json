            "Follows Marveena Meek, a Texas-based cowgirl-turned-psychic medium who helps guide people when they feel unbalanced, after family has cross over or when they are experiencing paranormal disturbances in the home. Throughout this series, we learn not only about Marveena's work as a medium in North Texas but also about her personal life. By staying close to nature and animals on her horse ranch, Marveena has been able to enhance her psychic abilities to a level that is extraordinary. As we follow her life, Marveena shares her fascinating experiences, what she has learned from the spirit world as an Ordained High Priestess, how the spirit world functions and why images of people who have passed or past events are presented to her by the dead in order to relate information to the living.::Elizabeth Hong"
