The series will be a roller-coaster ride of emotions, which will climax in the verdict. \"Verdict\" is not just about the accused, but the lawyers who work pro bono (voluntarily without pay) on the case, defending the accused who may not be able to afford a top lawyer. The series is about the humane and compassionate side of lawyers and the legal system.",
