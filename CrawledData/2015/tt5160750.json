            "In your 20s, somewhere between college and true adulthood, is a period of dissatisfaction. Your job isn't what you thought it would be, your relationships aren't turning out the way you envisioned them, and life in general doesn't feel anything like a reality you're comfortable with. You are confused, you are embarrassed, and you have no idea how to communicate any of that to anyone around you. And then, in the middle of all that ugh, you see a small and hopeful light at the end of a very dark tunnel... One thing connects! One thing makes sense, never mind the fact that you can't make sense of why it makes sense. And for the first time in a long time, you have some glimpse at something that might actually make you happy. _How to Not_ (qv) is a story about inelegantly chasing that one thing on the road becoming who you are. It starts as so many modern day romances start, all alone at night, half drunk and on the internet. This is my open love letter to anyone who's feeling like no one gets it, I just want you to know, you're not alone. So if your insomnia has struck again, and you're lurking the depths of the internet at 3am while devouring a sinful \"snack\" (fistfuls of croutons, maybe dipped in ranch?) and feeling lonely in a way you can't explain, this one is for you.",
