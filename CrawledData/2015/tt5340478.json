The duo only has four weeks to completely remodel the old house, and put it on the market. First, they must tackle the dated kitchen and maze-like floor plan. They'll completely gut the kitchen and tear down the walls separating it from the living room and dining room, creating one large Great Room. With an open concept floor plan, new cabinetry and top of the line appliances in the kitchen, Mark and Derek hope that this space will be a huge selling point to potential buyers.    "
