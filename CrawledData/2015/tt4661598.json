            "In the US someone is murdered every 36 minutes, but every 2 minutes someone is sexually assaulted. One in four women are sexually assaulted in their lifetime. 3% of murderers will kill again - 63% of rapists will rape again. Most rapists will continue to rape until they are caught. This show is about giving victims a forum to tell their story, solving cold case sex crimes, and prosecuting the offenders before they rape again."
