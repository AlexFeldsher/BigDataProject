Leaving behind the comforts of New Jersey, Rev Run, Justine, Russy, and Miley Simmons are about to embark on the trip of a lifetime. An around-the-world one-way ticket over 5 continents and 16 countries will give the family a taste of what it's like to be immersed in foreign cultures, customs, and languages where everything is just a little (or a lot) different than back home. Rev and his family won't leave each location until they've experienced a place to its fullest. Yes, there will be bumps in the road and unexpected turbulence along the way, but at the end of the day, great times await and comedy will ensue on this epic global adventure.::Departure Films"
