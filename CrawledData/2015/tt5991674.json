Ananya Singh is a 26-year old girl from Lucknow who has been working in Mumbai for the last 6 years. Simple, not very social and rather homely, Ananya is possessive and doesn't quite understand or appreciate all the female attention her boyfriend gets. Abhishek on the other hand, is a 28 year-old copywriter in a media firm. A party animal, he is best described as driven, ambitious and affable all at once! With a deliciously urban and youthful flavor, the series underlines what makes these two very different individuals click and sometimes clash, the show also elucidates all those things that are necessary for an urban Indian relationship to sustain itself and the daily challenges that come in the way.",
