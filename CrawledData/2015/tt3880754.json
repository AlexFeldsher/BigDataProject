To honor his recently deceased father, Joris returns on parole to the Wild West atmosphere of Horizonville. He immediately finds himself face-to-face with demons from his past: his brother, Charly, his childhood rival, Raymond, and Latin beauty, Cheyenne. Above the Station Horizon gas station, the Valais and American flag fly side-by-side. Outside, classic American cars, pickup trucks and motorbikes gleam, while horses graze in the meadows. At night, the locals head to the neon-lit Bar 66 for poker, strippers, country music and fighting. Station Horizon is a poignant and original series packed with good humor. The oddly endearing inhabitant of this strange town - a distant cousin of US Wyoming - are looking for elsewhere, but find it at home. In deciding to stay, Joris must confront his past and his future.",
