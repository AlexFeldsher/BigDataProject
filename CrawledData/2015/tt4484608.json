Over four episodes, our six contestants will be partnered up with their very own Strictly Come Dancing professional dance partner, before learning a Ballroom or Latin American dance, which they will perform on the Strictly Come Dancing Ballroom floor in the final episode. Their dances will be judged and scored by Head Judge Len Goodman, as well as Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli and professional dancer, Anton Du Beke. The Judges' scores will be for guidance only, and the public will have the deciding vote. The People's Strictly Champion will be crowned on March 13th, as part of the live Comic Relief show on BBC One, and the money raised will be spent helping to change the lives of poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged people in the UK and across Africa.",
