Selected by the quality of the primary source materials and covering the breadth of the four years of the war, potential portraits for the North could be: John Geary, Division Commander from Pennsylvania who fought in all the major campaigns and whose son died in his arms on the battlefield; the Taylor Brothers who were volunteers from the First Minnesota, one of whom died at Gettysburg; and Charles Wainwright, an artillery officer from New York whose voluminous diary was so good, it was published. The South could include: Edward Porter Alexander from Georgia whose memoir of his fighting in all the major battles is considered the best Southern memoir; Decimus et Ultimus Barziza from Virginia, named because he was the 10th and last child in his family, who was captured and escaped.",
