            "_An Klondike_ (qv) is the first Western to be made in Ireland and tells the story of the Connolly Brothers; three Irish emigrants who travel from Montana to the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush of the 1890's in the hope of striking it rich. The Connolly brothers pitch up in Dominion Creek where they become embroiled in a deadly feud with Jacob Hopkins, the man who runs the town. The Connollys become powerful figures in the Klondike themselves when their claim proves to be a goldmine but their new found wealth leads to a rift between the brothers. Jacob Hopkins uses this to his advantage to turn the Connollys against one another in the hope of wiping them all out for good."
