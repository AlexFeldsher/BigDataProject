Sometimes, he treats her kindly and cares about her; and other times he teases and embarrasses her in front of all their peers.

Taliw only has feelings for Tenten but her good friend King (Tao) fell for her and is trying his best to take her heart. Taliw also has a love-rival, Namkang, a girl who is taller, more beautiful, and brighter than her. Namkang seems to be the perfect person for Tenten. What Taliw will do with this situation?",
