(Do Kyungsoo), Baekhyun (Byun Baekhyun) and Sehun (Oh Sehun) from her favorite boy band EXO, who are looking to lay low for a while. They hire her to clean their house part-time during the winter vacation and that's when Yeon-hee found out that Chanyeol was her long lost childhood friend and crush \"Chan\" and is the grandson of the house owner.
