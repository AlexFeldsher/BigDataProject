        "plot outline": "Happy family, three lovely children, love and harmony - This world suddenly collapses when the heroine dies in a car accident. Her husband does not know how to live on, because all he wants - is to turn inward and lie on the sofa. But who will take care of children? They are so different! Each of them besides the common tragedy has his own problems and sorrows. But the trouble does not come alone - The miserable husband stumbles on his dad wife's diary when packing her things. And he was horrified to learn that the wife, which he believed to be an angel in the flesh, had been cheating on him for many years. Moreover, the eldest daughter is definitely not his child. The husband starts doubting about the rest of his children - Maybe, the single father would not handle this situation, would lose his heart. But the help will come - from the best friend of the deceased woman. This man and these children are the real family for her. Without trying to replace the mother, she will selflessly take care of them forgetting about her own personal life. And when the pain will subside, the hero will see next to him not just a good friend, not just a nanny for the children, but also an amazing woman.",
