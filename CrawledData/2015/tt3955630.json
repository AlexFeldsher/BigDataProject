A series chronicling the way people in the State of New Jersey play by their own set of Rules. The show examines how folks in New Jersey \"rule-the-roost\" when it comes to trendsetting and brash unashamed bravado. While the State of New Jersey is part of the United States of America, it is also a State of Mind. An up close look at how very often New Jersey serves as the cultural barometer and testing ground for much of American and Western culture. A dramatic-comedic review at how New Jersey politics, crime, corruption and fashion set the tone of American television and culture. No discernable reason can be articulated to encapsulate the nature of the activities that we all have become accustomed to hearing about and witnessing in the State of New Jersey. From \"Bridgegate\" to the unspoken bond between organized crime and the numerous law enforcement agencies in New Jersey, these events and relationships set the scene.",
