            "Each episode deals with a broken rule that results in some sort of problem for Stan. What drives Stan is a desperation to get out of his job. He needs to escape his job because he wants away from Housham the man who makes his life a misery. The other driver is his girlfriend Emma and his desire to set up a better future with her.The antithesis between Stans inward thoughts and what he wants to do verses what he actually ends up doing because either society compels him to behave in a certain way, or a situation forces his hand, means he breaks lifes unwritten rules. This therefore lands him in bizarre situations and left always looking like the idiot, when in his world everyone else is the idiot. The episodes contain a mixture of flashbacks and dream sequences and these coupled with the narration of Stans inward thoughts allow the audience to see how Stan wants to behave, what he wants to do but how he ultimately struggles to do so meaning the breaking of key rules."
