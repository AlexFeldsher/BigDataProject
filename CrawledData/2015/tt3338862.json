After the fall of the Empire, the paths outlived their builders, but their usage changed. For centuries, cities and villages, civilizations and cultures thus continued to develop along these routes. Today, this immense network of roads continues to traverse all of Europe. It bears witness to the wealth of ancient crafts and the diversity of traditions. Despite the domination of the Roman Empire 2 000 years ago, European countries have conserved all of their singularity. Where do we find traces of this \"golden age\" today? How were Roman foundations of culture and tradition reworked and developed through to the 21st century and in which regions did this occur? We set out to look for these influences on the ancient Roman roads of Europe, in villages and big cities, through encounters with artisans and the discovery of unusual social rites - by looking beyond intangible studies and dusty archaeological sites.",
