            "The Wild Way, is a new and unique concept bringing two very different worlds colliding in the great outdoors. Chef Lee Wright (Lee Wright), from Masterchef UK, and Adventurer / Explorer Adam D Short (Adam Short) set out to show that with the right knowledge and skills there really is no need to have to simply survive in the wild when you can live like kings.In each episode both hosts are put into survival situations that they must escape from whilst also gathering the right materials in order to build a comfortable camp and cook a healthy meal ensuring they remain safe and healthy whilst attempting to get rescued."
