            "You will travel to a place where boundaries engulf our dreams, a journey in the dark where there is only one destination \"The Seventh Dimension\".Bilal gets lost in a forest. A wood whose trees, leaves, soil have an energy that only the most courageous and intelligent can control.\nHicham Ouassem, a gym teacher loses Bilal during a punishment granted for having dried the gym class. Only Bilal is not aware that the forest can control people's minds until they lose all sense of reality. Hicham was touched by this uncontrollable energy when he was young with his cousin Salim Ouassem. He will not be able to separate things because his anger makes him blind. Hicham will lose the wire too. Salim will then intervene with the help of the great philosopher Bernard Veinard, in order to save a humanity who is torn apart by Georgette Henry, a manic and possessive director who wants to control everything in her own way. While a shady affair is organized with Edmund Acoly, the Minister of Education. This is a boon to the terrifying power of this forest. Suspense!\nThe Seventh Dimension plunges into the gloomy world of the Malentendu Show.The story of the Seventh Dimension focuses primarily on the characters of the web series The Malentendu Show. Bilal is the disruptive element of the story, it allows other characters to interact with each other. Hicham is the gym teacher, his cousin Salim will follow him in this adventure to replace him in the complicated moments.\nBernard Veinard the bitter philosopher will come to give his push to explain his philosophy of the Other, and the string theory that would have links with his theories. That man is able to travel through his transcendent consciousness. Even through the dream, which suggests that it is possible to travel in time and space that converge.\nMeanwhile Georgette Henry, an unscrupulous director will make order in her school, like a kind of Gestapo. Etienne Durand the history / Geo teacher, will play a kind of double game, to take the place of the director. Their relationship will not always be simple, he will seek by all means to put pressure on the Minister of Education who is in fact a manipulator.\nBrigitte the teacher of philosophy will do everything necessary for education to return to its normal state. That is to say on healthy bases."
