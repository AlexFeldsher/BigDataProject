Until that time, the only music that people heard was fleeting live performances; now for the first time they could listen whenever and wherever they wanted. Technology influenced musical styles. With mechanical recording, some instruments were too soft or too loud to record, violins needed the addition of a horn resonator in order to be heard and singers had to sing loudly as if they were ...
