Luckily, his best friend Damien is on hand to help him. Damien knows a thing or two about successfully navigating the gay scene so with his help, Matt gets involved. He writes about his experiences on his blog and along with a break up fresh in his mind he has to discover what love is all over again. This campaign is important to us as a team as it will help us to break the barrier of 'LGBT' stereotypes. It's our goal to show another side to a mostly unknown world and will hopefully give other LGBT members a show that they can enjoy and hopefully relate to in terms of the situations that our characters find themselves in.",
