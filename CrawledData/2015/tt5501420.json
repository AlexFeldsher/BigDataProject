        "plot outline": "A former agent Alex is a professional bounty hunter. Fathers, who refuse to pay their child support, and unfaithful wives, are out of his area of interest. He hunts vicious and ruthless criminals. Those who crossed the line. His task is to find a criminal and exchange him for a modest fee. Sometimes he gets paid by the State, sometimes - by private individuals. His former colleagues wish he worked with them, because he is the best in the business. But for Alex freedom is above all. Saint-Petersburg, its streets, roofs and courtyards - here Alex is in his own element. Criminals have no place to hide here - everyone and everything revolves around Alex. When the police hits a wall they call Alex. When his ex-wife Marina gets into trouble - she calls Alex. And he gets help only from a daredevil Tasya. But this adventurous girl often needs help herself. Tasya is crazy about Alex, and Alex is crazy about Marina. And Kate wants Alex to become a wealthy businessman. But hunting criminals is what he does best.",
