            "Taking place 100 years after Judgment Day, Steven and a band of rag-tag survivors must struggle to survive in an unchanging world. When they catch sight of a young boy, the only remaining child, they discover that he may be the key to them getting into Heaven. Now the chase is on to find the boy...before the \"Trainers\" do.::Publicity Dept.",
            "Judgment Day has come. Most of the world's population and all children have simply vanished. Those remaining cannot die, do not age and exist on an Earth; cursed, frozen in time, where all sources of power and energy have ceased and where daylight never ends. 100 years later, the last chance for redemption rests on an unlikely soul: Steven, a man once of the church, but now devoid of all hope or faith. After a fateful meeting with a kindred lost soul, he has a prophetic vision - that of a young boy - the one rumored key to the last remaining gate of Heaven, a gate that will soon close forever. Followed by a band of strangers, Steven races to find the boy and the gateway while faced with the startling revelations that people are once again becoming mortal and that nuclear power is being harnessed by a fanatic visionary set on throwing what's left of the world into tyranny and violence. Steven's journey will put him through Herculean tests where much is lost but which illuminate the true nature of his existence and the unique bond that he shares with the Boy, the strangers and with the Universe...all with an ultimate revelation of biblical proportions.::Michael Davies"
