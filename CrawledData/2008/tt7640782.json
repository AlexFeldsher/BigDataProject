In order to follow the trail of the Baroque period, one need only examine its mythic origins, which tell how the capital city was founded in the 16th century. Or tour the intricate passageways to remote missions that penetrate the Sierra Gorda mountains. Or simply indulge in viewing the beautiful homes and majestic churches built in the Santa Rosa de Viterbo or San Agustin style -paradigms of New Spanish architecture and the boom experienced by Queretaro in the 17th and 18th centuries.",
