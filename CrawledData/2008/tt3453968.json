        "plot outline": "In the world of organ transplants there is often overlapping and conflicting relationships, much like a love triangle, where there is one donor with the need organs and two very sick people to whom that organ may mean life and death, and, as it goes in a love triangle, where both people contend for the loved one's affection, so it is in the selection for an organ transplant, someone wins and someone loses. This is that story. The donor is Matt Mason, but his story lives on in the struggles of his pregnant wife, mother and father as they work through their loss and face their fears and aversion to organ transplant. The recipients are on total opposite ends of spectrum, Lucy is a young and vibrant college student with her life before her, who fears she'll not have time to live life and is making all the wrong choices in pursuit of experiencing all she can. Her Papa and Mama are caught in a never ending circle of trying to protect Lucy from her disease and from herself. Tony, on the other hand, was living life to its fullest with a wonderful wife, family and job, but a freak auto accident took it all away. Now he finds way to punish himself for living, much to the dismay of his home care nurse, Gene, who has fallen hopelessly in love with Tony-so much so that she will risk her license and risk rejection from Tony by using her connection with hospital heads to move him to the top of the Organ Recipient List. And then there are those who make the choices, the Transplant Team, who must not only determine who moves to the top of the list, but who, in a world of not enough donors, must also console and convince families to donate the organs of someone they love and have just lost. This is the story of the heartache and loss, the anxiety and pain, the desperation and duplicity that arise in the drama of organ transplants. The difference is that the viewers will decide who moves to the top of the list.",
