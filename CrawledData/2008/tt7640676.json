Separated on occasion by political differences brought on by the Revolution, or pushed aside either because they belonged to private enterprise or because they ran small-scale operations, the farmers of Sinaloa understood that further along down the road, their modern enemies and rivals would go by different names: a progressive lack of water, river pollution, technological drawbacks, and a lack of competitiveness on global markets. By accepting new challenges and preparing to meet them, Sinaloa stands today as a clear example of the capacity of Mexican agriculture to face the challenges of the future.",
