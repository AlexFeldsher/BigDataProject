        "plot outline": "Oil is and will continue to be the world's main energy source over at least the next 40 years. Three decades ago, Mexico became a major oil producer. But now the era of cheap, easy-to-find oil is coming to an end. Major fields are becoming exhausted, and the cost of production is rising. In order to satisfy a constantly growing demand, oil must be sought out in more complex zones, in smaller fields found at greater depths. This constitutes a monumental challenge. Despite being a country rich in hydrocarbons, Mexico must face the inevitable decline of its vast Cantarell field. The oil industry, then, must adapt to the new reality of cheap, easy petroleum coming to an end. The businesses that are able to better adapt to this new reality will be the ones that prosper, grow, and develop. A failure to change would mean condemning ourselves to decay. What are the key factors for success faced by oil companies under these new circumstances?",
