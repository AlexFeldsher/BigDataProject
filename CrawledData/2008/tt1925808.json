The soap opera was based on the Australian TV series Sons and Daughters. The soap opera rotates around two Sofia families, the affluent Konstantinovs and the low-income Belevs, who are mainly linked together by a central theme of love. It not only deals with the love of siblings who are unaware of each other, but also life in contemporary Bulgarian society. It has tackled controversial issues during its first season such as: murder, arson, kidnapping, abortion, homosexuality, rape, teacher-pupil relations and so on. Its second season started in autumn of 2009. Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov also had a part in one episode as himself.",
