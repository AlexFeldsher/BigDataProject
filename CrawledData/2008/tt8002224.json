His mother, Dulhan, had done this in order to protect him from the aftermath of the incident (although he had failed to comprehend it at the time).In the process though, Rehaan was cut off from his childhood friend and love, Sana and his beloved Dadi. The story picks up with Rehaan's return to Lucknow, trying to pick up from where he left off with Sana; Sana's reluctance to open herself up to him, for fear of being left in the lurch again and a new entrant into both their lives - the bright and effervescent young Anisa. Set in the backdrop of a city steeped in regal charm, 'Chand Ke Paar Chalo' paints a picture of melodic passion while touching on old-world values that otherwise tend to get lost in the pace of modern times.",
