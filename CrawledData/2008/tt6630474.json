The talent of the competitors is supervised by jury, made up of 3 \"skeptics\". They watch closely and analyze how the clairvoyants manage the challenges. The world-famous illusionist Astor, a professional psychologist and a former examining magistrate are the people who decide, which of the clairvoyants must leave the show.
