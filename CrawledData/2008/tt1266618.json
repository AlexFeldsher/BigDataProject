            "The adventures of a teenage female mage and her companions as they quest for gold and glory (especially gold).::Kenneth Chisholm",
            "In a medieval sword and sorcery world, there is one mage who is notorious for her power and grace (at least that's how she likes to put it), Lina Inverse. In reality, she is a teenage mage with a penchant for collateral damage, obnoxiousness and gluttony. This series chronicles her adventures with companions, such as the powerful but dumb swordsman Gourry Gabriev as she quests for gold and finds a heck of a lot trouble along the way.::Kenneth Chisholm <kchishol@execulink.com>",
            "When Lina Inverse and her friends are sent on a journey to another island to save the world, they find a dragon priestess and their old ally/foe Xellos. They also come across a strange new set of threats including a bandit with high explosives, a half demon/half dragon and an alien named Hellmaze who wants to save his world. His world is plagued by a powerful force called the Darkstar that destroys everything in it's path. But Hellmaze may not be able to save his world without sacrificing Lina's. And how does Gourry's sword of light fit in to all of this?::Stefan Robak",
            "Continuing where Slayers Revolution left off, the only way for Pokota's country to be save, the Hellmaster's jar must be found. It contains the soul of Rezo the Red Priest the one responsible for placing the magic seal on Pokota's country in the first place. So Lina Inverse and her friends guide Pokota on a quest to find the Hellmaster's jar, along the way they encounter the previously defeated Zuuma who seeks revenge on the group. While Xellos's role in the quest is questionable where it's unclear what he's really aiming for.::J LeGault",
            "After losing the Sword of Light in the previous quest, Lina & Gourry go on another quest to find a replacement weapon for Gourry to use. Along the way they reunite with their friends Amelia & Zelgadis while taunting a group of pirates. The reunion was pleasant until Lina encounters an Inspector name Wizer who is ordered to arrest Lina for reasons that is too unusual to explain.::J LeGault"
