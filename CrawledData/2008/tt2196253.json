When they arrive, Buzz asks them the question of the day and, with a correct answer, magic honey flakes fall from the sky and presto - the kids are no bigger than a wee bee and small enough to hang in the hive! Once inside, the kids learn about a variety of topics through discussion, participation, and dance-along songs. Kids love to spend their afternoons learning and laughing as they dance along to the sweet sound of Buzz and his hip house band, \"The Nectars\" (3 kids dressed in flower costumes playing a guitar, drums and keyboard) The kids ask Buzz for advice about all kinds of situations happening at home and school. Every episode features exterior segments where Buzz's friend, Field-Trip Freddie, a bold and adventurous explorer, navigates his spaceship to places relevant to the day's topic and reports back about the world outside the hive. B. Boppin' is a fresh mix of magic, music and educational content guaranteed to keep kids tuned in. B. Boppin' will raise children's awareness about the environment and their community as well as the importance of learning, caring and sharing, all the while keeping them active and entertained.",

            "Buzz Boppin' is the coolest bee on his block and his colorful Honeycomb Hangout is where all the kids swarm when school is out and class is in session.::Anonymous",
            "Each episode, 5 different kids come to visit Buzz in his Honeycomb Hangout. When they arrive, Buzz asks them the question of the day and, with a correct answer, magic honey flakes fall from the sky and presto - the kids are no bigger than a wee bee and small enough to hang in the hive! Once inside, the kids learn about a variety of topics through discussion, participation, and dance-along songs. Kids love to spend their afternoons learning and laughing as they dance along to the sweet sound of Buzz and his hip house band, \"The Nectars\" (3 kids dressed in flower costumes playing a guitar, drums and keyboard) The kids ask Buzz for advice about all kinds of situations happening at home and school. Every episode features exterior segments where Buzz's friend, Field-Trip Freddie, a bold and adventurous explorer, navigates his spaceship to places relevant to the day's topic and reports back about the world outside the hive. _B. Boppin'_ (qv) is a fresh mix of magic, music and educational content guaranteed to keep kids tuned in. _B. Boppin'_ (qv) will raise children's awareness about the environment and their community as well as the importance of learning, caring and sharing, all the while keeping them active and entertained.::Anonymous"
