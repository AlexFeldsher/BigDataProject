            "Mostly, it's just like college--the humor, the excitement, the drama, and, yes, the stress--but it's also been injected with the high-octane craziness that runs rampant in the Industry itself--the egos, the agendas, the love-triangles, the constant quotes from Back to the Future... Adam Welles (Ned Hosford), and his friends Fuego (Gerard Karsenti) and Matt (Jeff Kongs), navigate their way through two semesters of film school at the Hollywood Fine Arts Academy, struggling to master school work, relationships, and their Hollywood aspirations. The only difference between their lives and those of the celebrities around them is a few million dollars and a scandalous tabloid cover photo!"
