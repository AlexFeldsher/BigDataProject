This is shown mostly from the dash cams of the pursuing officers. Although, sometimes they show new's clips from helicopters and such. The show consists of two seperate people/incidents telling the story. Like all police shows, the perpetrators are always caught. What saves the show is hearing the commentary from the \"runners\" while they're watching the chase footage. Depending on the season, most of the people that ran are still incarcerated (most recieve 10 to 15 years) . Some are out already. It is a decent show, and the overall lesson is: Don't run from the cops, it never works out well, lol. Not only on TV, but many of my friends in real life will attest to the fact that you're not getting away... Having tried it in much faster cars, and still got caught and arrested.",
