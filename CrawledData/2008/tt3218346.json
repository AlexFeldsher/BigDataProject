        "synopsis": [
            "2000 saw the cancellation of the first video game review show, The Game Room. Mark Bussler, one of the show's hosts, would end up making documentaries for Inecom Entertainment documentary. Fast forward to 2007, Mark makes a tongue-in-cheek DVD documentary called Classic Game Room: The Rise and Fall for the Internet's Greatest Video Game Review Show, out of popular demand and having no subject to cover for another serious documentary. In 2008, he revives The Game Room as Classic Game Room HD (which would evolve into Classic Game Room) as a pet project of sorts. At first, Classic Game Room HD takes on a very subdued style compared to its Game Room counterpart. With its explosion in popularity in 2009 however, Mark began to readopt his signature raunchy humor from the old Game Room days. 2010 would see another reviewer come in, Derek D. Buck, but his presence in Classic Game Room HD was so negative that the spinoff, CGR Undertow was created. The following years would see Classic Game Room HD becoming Classic Game Room proper, the addition of additonal spinoffs like CGR Garage and CGR Toys, and more reviews. Today, Classic Game Room still airs to an audience around the world."
