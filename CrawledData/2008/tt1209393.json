She and her longtime friend Zero Kiryu keep peace at the academy, making sure no problems arise between the Day Class (humans) and the Night Class (vampires). However, the peace they try to keep is fragile, and personal feelings begin to interrupt their duty. It's based on the manga by Matsuri Hino, which is excellent. If VK is half as good as the manga, it'll be a great anime. (as I write this it has yet to air) There is some action, but expect more romance from VK.",
