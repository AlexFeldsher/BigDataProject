Adam had come to these parts to spend a holiday with his young wife; Robert the eternal bird of passage had cut short his roving lifestyle to settle here in a Hispanic colony. The two men are overjoyed to meet again, they have many years to catch up on. Then the great Tsunami came crashing onto these peaceful shores and the gigantic ocean waves flooded all around them. Only one of the two men survived. As he regains consciousness at hospital, at first he remembers nothing at all and he doesn't even know who he is.",
