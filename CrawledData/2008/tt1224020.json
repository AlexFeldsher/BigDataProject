On November 14, 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley of Vietnam, in a small clearing called Landing Zone X- Ray, 2,000 enemy soldiers surrounded 400 United States Army troopers. The ensuing battle was one of the most savage in U.S. history. Fight Or Die is a tribute to the nobility of those men under fire, their common acts of uncommon valor, and their loyalty to and love for one another.    "
