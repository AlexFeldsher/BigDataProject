Three years later, in 1962, the first Wal-Mart discount store was inaugurated in the city of Rogers, Arkansas in the United States. Both projects would play a leading role in the great revolution of self-service stores throughout the second half of the 20th century, and would join their destinies in Mexico to become our country's largest store chain. Today, nearly one billion people visit over one thousand, one hundred stores and restaurants across Mexico each year. An average of 1,680,000 crates of merchandise are moved through Wal-Mart's 13 distribution centers each day. Thanks to their their information systems, suppliers can learn on a daily basis how their items are selling, and plan their production accordingly. All this was made possible by the hard work, effort, and talent of thousands of associates, who over the course of 50 years made Wal-Mart Mexico what it is today, as well as over 160,000 associates currently trained to serve the needs of over 2.5 million customers each day.",
