Taarak Mehta is his friend, philosopher and guide. Although primarily a family comedy, the episodes are often centered on socially relevant issues.::Vijay Padiyar",
            "Gokuldham Society is a residential Society of Mumbai in which six Indian families, respectively headed by Mr Jethalal C. Gada, Mr Taarak Mehta, Mr Atmaram T. Bhide, Dr (Mr) Hansraj Hathi, Mr Roshan S. Sodhi and Mr Krishnan S. Iyer live. The members of these families have keen psychological attachment of love and sympathy for one another that makes them the members of a suppositious greater family. In the episodes of the show, the families are shown to live a life that a typical Indian family lives, but the characters, more often than not Jethalal, get into petty troubles cropping up from daily life activities that intensify in a comical manner, giving rise to laughter among the viewers. Humour in the show is further heightened by the individual quirks of the characters. Mr Popatlal Pandey, Shrimati Daya Gada, Sundarlal, Nattu Kaka, Baga etc. play supporting roles in the show. Whatever be the nature of the problem that a member of the Society encounters, all the other members stand by them through thick and thin to extend every possible help. In an episode, the cessation of the problem that a character faces is usually followed by a moral commentary meant for all the characters of the show as well as the viewers.",
