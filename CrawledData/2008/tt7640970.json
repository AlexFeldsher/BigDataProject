It seems like a long time has gone by since this house of higher education first opened its doors, thanks to a few young men who were ahead of their time. It was through them that science, technology, and the humanities took root in the state of Nuevo Leon. To truly understand the scale of their impact, we must go back to the early efforts made by the people of Nuevo Leon to overcome adversity and create a center of professional training they could rely on. Generation after generation, the university students of Nuevo Leon have blazed new trails into greater knowledge, strengthening their bonds with society and tailoring their teaching, research, and extracurricular activities to its needs. In light of the challenges posed by globalization today, the UANL continues to modify and modernize its educational portfolio, training the individuals who will drive national development and become more competitive worldwide.",
