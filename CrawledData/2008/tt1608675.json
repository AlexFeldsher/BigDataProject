Mihnea Zaharescu (Vlad Zamfirescu), Ana Dogaru (Eugenia Serban) and Augustin Popa (Virgil Ogasanu) are co-founders of the private Gynecology Clinic \"Materna\" in the busy city of Bucharest. Mihnea has moved up in his career, but he is not entirely happy. He could not leave behind his unresolved feelings for Mara Manea (Medeea Marinescu), former great love, whom he left out of reluctance to start a family. Mihnea and Mara work side by side at hospital, trying to keep their feelings well-guarded. Doctor Ana Dogaru (Eugenia Serban) dedicates her time to her patients and aspires to professional recognition. Her daughter, Cristina (Victoria Raileanu), considers her mother's absence and excessive preoccupation for her career the main reasons of their compromised relationship and she's not willing to forgive her. Sensitive, yet rebellious, Cristina takes refuge into a love story with her teacher of English, Paul Cristea (Mihai Ghior). Ana, on the other hand, is having a secret romance with the chief of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Stefan Dinu (Constantin Cotimanis) who has been through a bitter divorce. Although they are close, he is unwilling to commit to an official relationship. Inspired by real-life facts of the Central and Eastern European medical system undergoing a profound crisis, the cases described are at-the-edge situations, true challenges that come as consequence of human indifference and negligence. Mothers and Doctors presents and examines the miracle of life, reflecting on the need of change, but also on the hope for a different future.",
