Aaron Dexter (Australia), Mayur Kamath (India), Karla Munguia (Mexico), Julia Cartwright (Denmark), Bryan Grayson (UK), and Jin Pyn Lee (Singapore) went under a series of challenges to be judged on their final films. Mayur, the contestant from India, was the winner. Later, in July-August 2007, four new lucky contestants participated in the second series of the show: Amabel Adcock (UK), Sebastian van der Zwan (New Zealand), Mayuri Panse (India), and Jorge Cervera Hauser (México) spent a month living in the middle of award-winning Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa to be judged on their final films by a renowned international jury formed by Wildscreen President Harriet Nimmo, independent filmmaker Mike Birkhead, Animal Planet's commissioning editor Mark Wild, and conservationist Adrian Gardiner. The show aired worldwide on April 2008. Jorge from México was the winner of series 2, and his short documentary Pride Lost was broadcast worldwide during 2008.",
