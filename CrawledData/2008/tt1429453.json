Hammer, Calito, Hanna and Sandy, four gifted teenagers, are trained as Earth's last line of defense. But with 5 different Psi-Bots ready for battle, a new pilot must join the team. The newcomer, Jacques, has a hard time fitting in. His enormous, latent Psi-Powers are only surpassed by his ego and so he is constantly fighting with his fellow Ravens and especially Calito, for the position of the Ace pilot and team leader.
