Being declared the host of the Olympic Games in 1968 -something never before achieved by a Spanish-speaking country- confirmed that progress was being made both at home and abroad. But this particular Olympic year coincided with major confrontations in Mexico and around the world. The suspicion that the Mexican Olympics would be a failure began to take hold in some sectors of the international community. The violent repression of the student movement on October 2 in Tlatelolco Plaza, as well as the tensions unleashed by the Cold War, were not an ideal setting for the Olympic spirit. And yet, on October 27, these fears were dispersed during the most emotional closing ceremony ever. By then, the world was certain that an unforgettable page of sports history had been inscribed by Mexico in the brotherhood of nations.",
