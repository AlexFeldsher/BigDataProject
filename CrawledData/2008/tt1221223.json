            "\"Change your image, change your life.\" That's the motto that star stylist Peter Ishkans lives by. This British fashion guru has catered to Tinseltown's elite (his clients include Eva Longoria and Eva Mendes) and now he's ready to lend his expertise to real people looking to revamp their struggling businesses. In the premiere season of _Peter Perfect_ (qv), meet our perfectly snobbish (and perfectly stylish!) host as he gives these businesses a fabulous floor-to-ceiling makeover--owners and employees included! From a far-from-chic hair salon to shabby gourmet coffee shop, follow along as Peter uses his makeover mojo to transform these businesses from flat to fierce in just a few days. Can he save a struggling surf shop from a financial wipeout? How about bringing a withering floral shop into full bloom? No task is too big for this bold Brit as he helps these shops bring out the beauty that lies within."
