Kamen Rider Wing Knight is the sole surviving Kamen Rider - the only man who can stop Xaviax from destroying Earth the same way he destroyed Ventara. To defeat Wing Knight, Xaviax brought the Advent Decks to Earth and tricked ordinary citizens into becoming new Kamen Riders - super-powered soldiers who will carry out his evil plans.
