            "Over nearly 20 years, Det. Dave Reichert of the King County Sheriff's Department investigated a series of brutal murders by a serial killer who became known as the Green River Killer after the location where some of his early victims were found. All the victims were women involved in prostitution. The police used the tools available at the time including an FBI profiler. They even interviewed serial killer Ted Bundy who was on death row at the time and offered his insight into the killer. Several men came under suspicion and were interviewed at length and at one point, Reichert was convinced he knew the identity of the killer. It was not until DNA matching came into being that they had the evidence to proceed. The killer eventually admitted to killing 71 women.::garykmcd"
