Three antiques dealers go into their homes to bid for items they want to buy. Independent valuers put an estimate on how much they think the items are worth. This figure is revealed to the seller and the audience at home. Items are found by the dealers, who make their own valuation and try to purchase them by placing a cash offer on items around the home and give some advice or information on the Antiques. The bids are left in sealed envelopes next to the desired items and the offers are kept secret from fellow dealers until the homeowners opens them. Dealers are allowed to revise their offers up either by placing a new sealed bid next to the item or upping their bid when the homeowners sees their offer. The seller then decides whether to accept or decline the deal. If they think it is worth more it will often end in a bidding war to see what dealer will pay the best price and take the item.",
