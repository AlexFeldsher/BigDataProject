Professor Tim Sharp believes that food problems are simply a symptom of being unhappy. And by using positive psychology techniques he can get anyone happy. Tim's putting positive psychology to the test in a 'world first' experiment in treating eating problems. The 5 participants will work together at weekends over a 2-month period. They'll discover they have strengths, learn to face their fears, work out what they really want from life and discover a path to get there. What they won't do is talk about food, count calories, or weigh themselves and This is what makes Prof Sharp's approach revolutionary.",
