        "plot outline": "A National Geographic original documentary series that takes the viewer up close to see the day-to-day workings of United States law enforcement officers on and near the border and at the ports of entry. Episodes include officers and agents from Customs and Border Protection, Border Patrol, Air and Marine Interdiction, and ICE, as well as local police. The series covers officers and agents working on the southern border as well as in Miami and Puerto Rico as they serve as America's frontline of defense, preventing the inflow of illegal drugs, aliens, illegally imported goods, terrorists and terrorist weapons into the country. Other episodes deal with officers who investigate perpetrators of other crimes such as possession of child pornography or identity theft, and some specials include officers' work on Super Bowl Security as well as reflecting on the effects of violence on the American side of the border.",
