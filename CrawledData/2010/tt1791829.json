The Australian mX newspaper offers redemption for individuals suffering from this 'why didn't I just say hi?' syndrome. A daily 'Here's Looking At You' column gets filled with messages from people trying to find a stranger that could be 'someone'. LOOKING AT YOU offers a unique insight into what strangers are really thinking (and texting) when they catch your eye on the train home! Three tales structure the series; A teenage crush in which a love-struck 16 year old gets dangerously close to saying hi to 'that' guy! A twenty-something couple, complete strangers that share a regular morning wait at South Yarra train station. They exchange nothing more than a glance, with the hope of one day exchanging more. Finally, two business commuters who have been catching the same train home for years. Attracted to each other, or at least the idea of going somewhere other than home to their respective partners. The three stories twist and turn amongst a diverse blend of entertaining one off incidents and encounters that can only occur between complete strangers on public transport! The final episode brings a climatic end to the three main narratives with the audience sure to ask, \"Who will speak and who will continue to wonder What If?\"",
