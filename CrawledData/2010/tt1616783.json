        "plot outline": "The series tells the story of Alvina Montenegro (Jean Garcia) and her three children, Rav Dion Ignacio, Rossan (Iwa Moto), and Rizzi (Jennica Garcia) who all have different fathers. Despite such unconventional set-up, Alvina fully embraces her duties as a mother and only has the best interest of her family at heart. Of the three, Alvina is closest to Rizzi, who, unlike Rav and Rossan, grew up without the privilege of having a father around. Until one day, a man by the name of Daniel Bustamante (Ariel Rivera) arrives at Alvina's doorstep and claims to be Rizzi's father. Owing to her materialistic nature, Alvina doubts Daniel's capability as a father due to his financial instability. Rizzi, on the other hand, wants to be with Daniel. And days before her 18th birthday, Rizzi plans a rendezvous with Daniel in order for them to finally be together, as well as to break free from Alvina's manipulative ways. Desperate to prove himself to Alvina, Daniel dabbles in business but in the process, ends up losing all of his hard-earned savings. This prompts him to commit a crime and he ends up in jail causing him to miss what might have been his last chance to finally be with his daughter. Life goes on for Alvina and her children but nothing is the same again. Alvina is able to convince Rizzi that Daniel has abandoned her but at what cost? Rossan's rich politician dad turns his back at her, while Rav's mental condition a result of a traumatic incident as a child becomes worse forcing him to risk his own life. As a result, Alvina couldn't help but blame herself for her children's misfortune and categorizes herself as a failure in being a mother. Can Alvina still find enough faith and fortitude to rebuild her family? More importantly, can she find it in her heart to forgive herself?",
