            "When New York fashionista Gillian Green goes to visit her sister Alicia in small town Georgia, she's met with more than a few surprises. Not only is her big sister laid up with an injury, she expects Gillian to help her with her two rambunctious kids until she gets back on her feet. Never one to back down from a challenge, Gillian jumps in to help, but not without some resistance from Alicia's husband, Cedric. Eventually, Gillian stops feeling like a fish out of water as she connects with her family - and a handsome local. But just as Gillian begins to consider giving up city life for small town living, she gets a phone call that could change everything. [Yidio.com, TBS.com]"
