        "plot outline": "The tower is the highest building in modern Moscow. It is a symbol of ambition, success and status. At once a terrible explosion will transform the tower into the place of imprisonment of heroes. In isolation from the outside world they will be looking for a salvation to themselves. They will cry for help, try to find the culprit, lose hope, betray each other, feel pity for themselves, remember the past, dream about the future, feel despair. Trying to find a logical explanation for what is happening they inevitably reach an impasse together and one by one. These are people, for whom space is suddenly narrowed, preventing the usual picture of the world. They will be forced to change themselves, gradually realizing that the solution of this problem is not at the entry. The tower will become an infernal machine for redemption, giving chance to survive. We will see how many trials modern men need to go through to find themselves again in this world. The tower will be exploded.",

            "The tower is the highest building in modern Moscow. It is a symbol of ambition, success and status. At once a terrible explosion will transform the tower into the place of imprisonment of heroes. In isolation from the outside world they will be looking for a salvation to themselves. They will cry for help, try to find the culprit, lose hope, betray each other, feel pity for themselves, remember the past, dream about the future, feel despair. Trying to find a logical explanation for what is happening they inevitably reach an impasse together and one by one. These are people, for whom space is suddenly narrowed, preventing the usual picture of the world. They will be forced to change themselves, gradually realizing that the solution of this problem is not at the entry. The tower will become an infernal machine for redemption, giving chance to survive. We will see how many trials modern men need to go through to find themselves again in this world. The tower will be exploded.::2Plan2"
