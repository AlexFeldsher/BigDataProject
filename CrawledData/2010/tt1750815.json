In New York, he eats the goat Billy Balls at The Meatball Shop which has locals lining up until 4am for their succulent round morsels. On the opposite coast, Rahm visits the Pacific Dining Car in Los Angeles for a Maine Lobster Appletini appetizer and a Cowboy Steak with creamed spinach served 24-hours a day. His last stop at the Gilt Club in Portland, Ore., a swanky late-night supper spot, dishes up its house made pork rinds and Quail in a Jar late into the night.    "

            "Meet Rahm Fama. Actually, \"Meat\" Rahm Fama! A chef and meat nerd originally from New Mexico, Rahm combs the country for the choicest cuts. He obsesses over meat with fellow chefs, local foodies, and passionate chowhounds across the United States, making several stops in each episode to sample their meaty fare. From mounds of meatballs in New York and chicken-fried steak in Texas to loaded gourmet hotdogs in Chicago and monster beef patties in Oregon, Rahm's carnivorous curiosities uncover the most mouth-watering meats and the side dishes that so perfectly complete them. Rated \"M\" for meat, vegetarians beware."
