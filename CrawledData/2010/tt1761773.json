            "Pen Talar, Rhydycaeau, Tywi Valley, 10 year old Defi Lewis home and the centre of his universe. The perfect, Arcadian childhood - blissful innocence. But a darkness lurks on the horizon that will change his life forever. On the day of JFKs assassination Defi and his best friend Doug witness their own atrocity - the death of innocence of the entire Western world de-marking the death of theirs. Theyre fate is sealed, blood brothers forever bound by a horrible secret.An epic odyssey, a sweeping state of the nation, this 9 x 60 series visits them at different turning points in their political and emotional development, from that fateful November day in 1962, through the decades to 2010, and everything in between.From the student riots of the late 60s, the social upheaval and Thatcherism of the 70s and 80s, through the swinging nineties to today, this is an exhilarating, defiant kaleidoscope of collective memory that for some is a tale of paradise lost, for others the hope of a paradise regained.This is the Welsh Heimat, a truly European drama with a resonance way beyond its borders. A drama about wanting to be heard, of wanting to connect, from the personal to the particular to the universal. A drama about a dreamer, a hero in a nation on its knees, a man hellbent on achieving his fathers dream - a man with a passion for home that never dies.Co-written by BAFTA award winning writer Ed Thomas and acclaimed Welsh playwright Sion Eirian and co-directed by Ed and BAFTA award winning director Gareth Bryn. Pen Talar was shot on location in Mid Wales and Cardiff, and led by a vast and talented cast featuring Richard Harrington (Bleak House, Spooks, Holby Blue) as Defi Lewis, Ryland Teifi (Caerdydd, Rhyw fondue a Deinasors, Pobol y Cwm) as Doug Green, Mali Harries (The Indian Doctor, Foyles War, Ar y Tracs) as Sian Lewis, Aneirin Hughes (Spooks, Eastenders, A Mind to Kill) as John Lewis, and Eiry Thomas (Cwcw, A Mind to Kill, Eastenders) as Enid Lewis"
