From elaborate plans to comic strategies, Angelo sweet-talks and works his way around his various adversaries and problems. He's a genius with a knack for getting out of trouble. He's a stop-at-nothing kind of kid, undaunted by any thing put in his way. The bigger the challenge, the bigger the plan. Angelo without a plan? Unthinkable. Sure, he's got the usual obstacles - siblings, parents, and school rules. Who hasn't? He hasn't got any superpowers to rely on, just his wits. The main weapons in his arsenal are clever planning, irreverent attitude, a rebellious nature, optimism, and, most of all, charisma. Combine those traits with his two best friends, Sherwood, the king of logistics and Lola whose own enthusiasm can even eclipse Angelo's, and you've got a winning trio. With a knowing smile and an arched eyebrow, Angelo can give you the lowdown on how to get exactly what you want. If you know what's good for you, you better listen closely.",

There are adults, siblings, teachers and rivals telling you what to do, what not to do, what to say, and blah blah blah...Well it's time for us kids to take control! I'm here to show you the way. Sure I have an annoying kid brother, a big sister who gets to do just about anything, and two parents who boss me around...But to me, they're all just my guinea pigs who unwittingly help me craft my theories.\nI observe and then come up with elaborate strategies to wheedle, sweet-talk, con, and work around any adversary. Luckily, my friends Lola and Sherwood are here to help me!"
