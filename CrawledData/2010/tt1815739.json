A self-proclaimed cliché (aspiring actress by day and waitress by night), Quinn feels her dreams of silver screen stardom actualizing as a waking nightmare of never-ending obstacles and roadblocks. Broke, tired, confused and, constantly tripping over her mark, she's literally bruised, at times self-deprecating, but delightfully determined and never defeated. With life, heart, spirit and the carefree, fun-loving support of her three best friends, Quinn looks past the setbacks and black-and-blues to see her shining star on the walk of fame, which to her isn't too far ahead. Or maybe it is. She is determined to conquer Hollywood, but the road to stardom is full of missteps. \"Two steps forward and ten steps back,\" like the show's original theme song says, \"She's there for life: She's a Hollywood Girl.\"",

            "Created by Courtney Zito, and based on her real life experiences in Los Angeles, _Hollywood Girl_ (qv) follows the comically blundering, yet inspirationally uplifting, life of celebrity hopeful, and beautiful disaster, Quinn Monroe. A self-proclaimed cliché (aspiring actress by day and waitress by night), Quinn feels her dreams of silver screen stardom actualizing as a waking nightmare of never-ending obstacles and roadblocks. Broke, tired, confused and, constantly tripping over her mark, she's literally bruised, at times self-deprecating, but delightfully determined and never defeated. With life, heart, spirit and the carefree, fun-loving support of her three best friends, Quinn looks past the setbacks and black-and-blues to see her shining star on the walk of fame, which to her isn't too far ahead. Or maybe it is. She is determined to conquer Hollywood, but the road to stardom is full of missteps. \"Two steps forward and ten steps back,\" like the show's original theme song says, \"She's there for life: She's a _Hollywood Girl_ (qv).\"::Courtney Zito"
