            "THE INSIDE STORY OF ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF THE F.B.I. DISTILLED FROM HOURS OF EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH 50 AGENTS, EX AGENTS AND DIRECTORS OF THE F.B.I. ILLUSTRATED WITH THE BEST AVAILABLE ARCHIVAL MATERIAL\nEach film will be rich in references to popular culture and based on exemplary cases recounted by first-hand witnesses. By investigating contemporary themes, we will bring to life the 100 year old culture of the F.B.I. Reliving and debating key moments pertinent to contemporary issues. Whistle blowers and loyal troops will confront their views on the bureaus attitudes and actions. As we investigate cases, we will pepper our narrative with down to earth [nitty-gritty] facts about the daily life of the agents concerned, highlighting the evolving reality of the Federal Agent. The storyline and the treatment will have all the tension and the pace of current F.B.I. based hits for T.V. The images will carry us into every corner of the U.S. It will also propose an original history of 20th Century America.\nEach episode will be propelled by a contemporary situation linked to a theme and we shall unwind the heritage that led to the manners and methods the F.B.I currently employs. An intricate weaving of; movie extracts, news archives, spy camera footage, the agents personal archives, and agent interviews integrated through state of the art graphics into a high speed story line. A unique collection that is both a critical history of the FBI and an insiders view of its organization. The most difficult questions facing modern police forces will be treated, and the central quandary posed by the equilibrium\nbetween freedom and safety in contemporary society will constitute the thematic backbone."
