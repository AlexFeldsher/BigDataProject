            "Open the lid to a fantasy world full of fun, music, learning and adventure! The bedroom door swings open and a toy box is spilled on its side in a jumble of shapes and colours. No-one is around...all is quiet...and then something magical happens - every child's dream comes true as the toys spring to life! Now we've become tiny', the bedroom is our place of play and the toys are our new best friends. There is a funky doll named Tina who is energetic and sporty. Her cheery friend Tom is an adventure doll that loves exploring and being creative. Patches, the cute rag doll, is shy and sensitive whilst Super Ned is a brave and excitable toy robot that loves rescuing! Lastly is the comical madness of the toy rabbits, Remy and Rici, with their cheeky and bickering antics. Aimed at children age 2 - 5 years, each episode has an overall story, interspersed with songs, drawings, spelling and number activities, as well as dance and movement sequences. Join the fun as the toys come alive and the adventures begin!"
