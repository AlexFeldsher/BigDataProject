        "plot outline": "In 1857, the passage of a new liberal Constitution radically confronted two different national projects. On one hand, the liberal project-led by Benito Juárez, Ignacio Comonfort, and Melchor Ocampo, among others-that proposed the definitive construction of a secular state, stripping the clergy of its enormous influence over public and private lives of Mexicans and establishing the need to possess equal laws for all that would leave behind the old corporate privileges. On the other hand, the conservative project sought to leave life just at it had been for three hundred years during the colony without any substantial changes, leaving the Church as the center--directly linked to Vatican policy--that ruled over society and the economy. This profound political disagreement would, in the end, be settled on the battlefield over the next three years.",
