        "plot outline": "MICHAEL FEINSTEIN'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK returns for a second season with three new episodes that take viewers on a musical journey across America and through time, as the acclaimed musician and five-time Grammy-nominated vocalist goes broader and deeper in his ongoing quest to celebrate and preserve classic 20th century popular song. Episode 1, 'Time Machines' explores how technology has preserved--and altered--the way we think about the great songs and singers of the past. Feinstein introduces viewers to Soundies (the original music videos,) the historic Kansas City building where \"jam sessions\" were born, and an eclectic array of performers and collectors who help keep the music alive, including the avid collector and music lover Hugh Hefner, who shares rare footage of cabaret legend Bobby Short, and the British crooner Al Bowlly. Episode 2 'Lost and Found' investigates a mysterious musical manuscript attributed to Irving Berlin and unveils an unpublished, unrecorded song by legendary Broadway composer/lyricist Jerry Herman. Along the way he meets a Wisconsin collector with a giant 'storage condo' containing rare Irving Berlin recordings. Episode 3 'Saloon Singers' celebrates the allure of musical nightlife from Delta juke joints to Las Vegas showrooms, where Feinstein examines the legacy of Liberace, the original King of Bling. He visits nightclub pioneer Rose Marie (she literally 'opened' Las Vegas in 1946) and the poet and author Maya Angelou, who once earned her living doing a calypso nightclub act in San Francisco.",

            "In \"Show Tunes\", Feinstein explores songs from Broadway. In \"Let's Dance\", he examines the connection between music and choreography and in \"On the Air\" he examines the impact radio had on popular culture in the 20th century.::Amber Edwards",
            "MICHAEL FEINSTEIN'S AMERICAN SONGBOOK returns for a second season with three new episodes that take viewers on a musical journey across America and through time, as the acclaimed musician and five-time Grammy-nominated vocalist goes broader and deeper in his ongoing quest to celebrate and preserve classic 20th century popular song. Episode 1, 'Time Machines' explores how technology has preserved--and altered--the way we think about the great songs and singers of the past. Feinstein introduces viewers to Soundies (the original music videos,) the historic Kansas City building where \"jam sessions\" were born, and an eclectic array of performers and collectors who help keep the music alive, including the avid collector and music lover Hugh Hefner, who shares rare footage of cabaret legend Bobby Short, and the British crooner Al Bowlly. Episode 2 'Lost and Found' investigates a mysterious musical manuscript attributed to Irving Berlin and unveils an unpublished, unrecorded song by legendary Broadway composer/lyricist Jerry Herman. Along the way he meets a Wisconsin collector with a giant 'storage condo' containing rare Irving Berlin recordings. Episode 3 'Saloon Singers' celebrates the allure of musical nightlife from Delta juke joints to Las Vegas showrooms, where Feinstein examines the legacy of Liberace, the original King of Bling. He visits nightclub pioneer Rose Marie (she literally 'opened' Las Vegas in 1946) and the poet and author Maya Angelou, who once earned her living doing a calypso nightclub act in San Francisco.::Amber Edwards",
            "In \"Show Tunes\" Michael Feinstein strives to unearth lost moments on Broadway. Stephen Sondheim talks about his 1971 musical, \"Follies\", his homage to his favorite songwriters, and shows Michael some rare home movie footage of the original production. Tony Award-winner Christine Ebersole gives a tour de force performance of a rarely-sung showstopper from the stage musical \"Funny Girl\", and Angela Lansbury reflects on her Broadway career, from \"Mame\" to \"Sweeney Todd\" and Feinstein surprises her with film footage of her Tony-winning performance in the first revival of \"Gypsy.\" And Feinstein discusses his personal relationship with the lyricist Ira Gershwin and how being fired as his archivist launched his performing career. In \"Let's Dance\", he asks why Fred Astaire was the favorite singer of so many great songwriters. Liza Minnelli - herself a dancer - analyzes what made Astaire unique, and compares and contrasts Astaire with Gene Kelly. And Feinstein takes some private dance lessons in an attempt to understand enduring appeal of social dance and its cultural impact. In \"On the Air\", Feinstein shows how, in its heyday, radio was the equivalent of American Idol as a starmaker and shaper of tastes. He recalls the radio icons of the past, such as Bing Crosby, Rudy Vallee, and Kate Smith with first-hand stories from Rose Marie, who started her career as a child radio star. And we go behind the scenes of his own NPR radio program with guest artists violinist Joshua Bell and pianist Jeremy Denk.::Amber Edwards"
