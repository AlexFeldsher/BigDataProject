Reverend Ralph Wall breaks the story to sing to the audience about God's accomplishments and the sins of rock music. Casper plays a singalong for his friends. Reverend Ralph Wall, as Cowboy Carl, joins the teens to talk about the time he met God, who apparently smells good and likes Cap'n Crunch ...    "
