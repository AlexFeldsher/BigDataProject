        "plot outline": "Seo Hye Young is a talented second-year obstetrician, but when a patient desperate to abort her second child begs her to perform the surgery, she reluctantly agrees. She's promptly blacklisted and transferred from a prestigious hospital in Seoul to an obscure country hospital. To make things worse, she realizes that she herself is pregnant-and the father is a married man. Rebuilding her life in the wake of these events, Hye Young struggles to keep her pregnancy secret from her co-workers. She clashes with Lee Sang Shik, a pediatrician at the new hospital, while an old friend, Wang Jae Sook, re-enters her life. Award-winning actress Jang Seo Hee (Temptation of a Wife) stars alongside Go Joo Won (Kim Soo Ro) and Suh Ji Suk. Rising young actor Song Joong Ki (Sungkyunkwan Scandal) adds even more talent to this story that tracks the medical and human dramas in a hospital's obstetrics department.",
