            "His-Story about growing up in a World of Stupid People he calls Sheeple, a childhood Dream about this Wizzard that tales him how the Universe works, becoming a Sheep Dog, he tales his-story to the Sheep thru the White Wizard.::Jeffrey Scott Flesher",
            "_The Light Wizzard in the Flesh_ (qv) is His-Story of how this Light Wizzard comes to him in his Dreams and explains how the Universe works at the Subatomic Level using this White Noise that his Parents told him was the Light of God, he gets into trouble staring at this Light throughout his life, Adults would always tell him that he was wrong about how the Universe works, telling him he is no Einstein, even though his IQ is much higher then Einsteins in the 3rd Grade, so he stops talking about the Wizzards because he becomes bored with Sheeple telling him he would understand when he grows up, so he Grows up and becomes a Staff Sergeant in the United States Air Force, he was an F-111 Computer Test Station Technician and was awarded a Meritorious medal for bringing the F-111 program in a year ahead of time with a 30% improvement to the system, so that it could be used in the Gulf War, after the Gulf War, he start to come down with Gulf War Syndrome, even though the Military tells him he does not have it, he cross trained into Air Rescue and Special Operations as a Helicopter Crew Chief, after being medically retired for Symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome and getting divorced at the same time, he decided to start a website talking about what happened, then in 2000 his father calls him a month before he dies and tells him an old family secret: you are an Ashkenazi who was diagnosed with Autism and a high IQ in the 3rd grade, and then the Dreams became more intense and he could not longer sleep, suffering from a rare sleep disorder he has no REM sleep, and he can no longer tell the difference between dreams and what happened, so he writes a Series to explain all this, on the way he got his PhD in Physics, proving that the Light of God Isaac Newton talked about as being the Force in all his Equations, is now Science in the Book \"The Principles of the Trinary Universe\", so this is His-Story.::Jeffrey Scott Flesher"
