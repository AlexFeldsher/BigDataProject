            "The Nazi Hunters painstakingly hunted down some of the most hated and reviled people on earth. Sometimes they did it for the highest of motives but sometimes resorted to methods that, when revealed, would horrify their own supporters.They were chasing men whose war crimes were so horrendous that they demanded retribution. And there were many prepared to pursue the perpetrators until justice was done, from Churchill to the SAS to the Strategists who planned the D-Day landings and Mossad. These stories of pursuit and the struggle to balance the scales of justice are full of drama, intrigue and tragedy. Who should be pursued? Should death always be the penalty for Nazi war crimes? In some cases it was alleged that it was the pursuers who lose their sense of decency and proportion. These are some of the great vengeance stories of the last hundred years."
