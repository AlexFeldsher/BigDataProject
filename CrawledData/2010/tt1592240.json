Having sampled a brief taste of success as a star on the former sitcom \"Greg The Bunny,\" Warren's life has been in a downward spiral ever since the show got canceled. Over the past few years, Warren has paid more attention to drinking, drugs and women than his career, which lately has consisted of seedy exploitation films and a regrettable string of skin flicks.
