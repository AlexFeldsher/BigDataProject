While she knows that she once knew the answer to the question when asked, it invariably vapourises like a dream when she tries to think of it. Fortunately, she has various companions in the Information Station to help her out. None of them can completely answer the question but all of them have a fact or two that will help her towards an answer. Whether it is her companion Squirm, a sock puppet occasionally on her right hand, Hank and Frank - two wisecracking fish or Trewey, a shadow rabbit able to illustrate stories by instantly transforming into different characters - all of them provide lots of information, only a small portion of which is correct. When the child returns to get the answer to her question, Penelope K has a jumble of facts. In every episode the child helps the confuddled Penelope K to sort out the facts and discover the answer. Each is a comic journey of realisation with the core idea that being wrong is just the first step to being right.",
