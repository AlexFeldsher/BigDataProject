            "Hellbent is a pilot for a single camera half-hour comedy about the struggles of three washed-up small town ad execs who decide they can make millions by building a phony televangelist ministry.Their incompetence gets them every time, but each time they lose, they get up, dust off, and start again. In the process they manage to destroy Muslim hit squads sent to collect unpaid bills for their offshore call center, fundamentalist preachers who want to \"take out\" the competition, kooky heiresses living the Christian Poverty Lifestyle in their mansions, and recovering alcoholic NASCAR drivers. And that's just the first four episodes.We have shot a teaser and several scenes from the complete pilot script. We have a show Bible, three episode treatments and are currently looking for production partners to bring the project to network or cable.Written and Produced by Rob Lindsay, Rob Lindsay Pictures"
