Throughout this season, the organization faces a number of huge tasks - from illegal fishing, to highly organized poaching rings with criminal networks stretching into Asia and the Pacific, to the relentless tide of reckless shell food gatherers and recreational fishermen who often exceed their daily limit. Carrying out over 27,000 inspections, seizing boats, vehicles and other fishing equipment, watch as they fight to prevent illegal coastal activity and do whatever it takes to keep the environment clean.",
