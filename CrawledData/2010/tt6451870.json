As the narrator, police inspector Gavric (Gordan Kicic) meets with an associate of \"Bole\" at the Belgrade airport named Misa Grof (Zoran Cvijanovic), a story about Bole and his exploits begins to unravel. Bole is a serial con artist, who meets mostly older and will situated women on trains, then tricks them into liking him and disappears as soon as he has had a chance to get some of their money. As the noose around Bole tightens from the police and thugs hired by a well placed brother of a women he scorned, we begin to learn more about his life, motivation and his self perception. In a somewhat predictable turn of fortunes at the end, Bole has to pay the price for his misdoings before he finds his Eldorado. A funny, simple and focused tale that does not pretend to be more than it is, this movie delivers.",
