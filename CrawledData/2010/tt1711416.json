When the ruler of their realm, King Claudio, invites the male inhabitants of the kingdom to enter into contests of skill and strength for the hand of his daughter, the Princess Vanessa, the twins resolve to join. But even though he wins the contests hands-down, Calderon is forsaken because of his less-than-desirable looks. A mysterious stranger bequeaths to Calderon a magic lantern that transforms him into the dashing contender Calano, but questions about his identity put Calderon's possible victory and the love of the beautiful princess in jeopardy.",
