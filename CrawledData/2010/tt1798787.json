Illness jokes, paedophilia, homosexuality, murder, or just about anything that is generally accepted in society as a poor subject to joke about. Right, Warning finished.This show will kill you. How? You won't be able to breathe from laughter. This man is a sick man and yet as funny as any comedian I have ever seen. Funnier in fact. His humour is most definitely adult and his content is most definitely taboo in most arenas. That is why this shockingly funny show is so good. It helps if one has a low standard of morals before watching though. If you take life seriously, do not watch this - It will upset you.I give this show 10/10. Pure genius Frankie Boyle."
