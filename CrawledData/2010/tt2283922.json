It delivers a probing and insightful look into the world of modern celebrity, delivered with trademark breathless self-importance. Rather than bothering with boring election coverage or dwelling on depressing economic news, WTF! focuses only on important news: like Heidi Montag's latest plastic surgery botch job, or Lindsay Lohan's prison survival strategies. FIRST WITH THE NEWS WTF! It brings you all the celebrity news you need to know before anyone else even knows it's news. WTF! is able to get there first because it doesn't just cover all the celebrities you know and love, it also has the scoop on a slate of \"in-house celebrities\", who WTF! has exclusive access to. Whether it's the latest drug-fueled hijinks of fading tween billionaires Aphrodite Onassis, or the worryingly violent outbursts by our in-house celebrity chef Bruce Hitler, the WTF! team is there with footage that nobody else can get, because these celebrities' lives are patented creations of the WTF! Corporation. FRESH GOOD-LOOKING TEAM Produced daily, the show is anchored by hot sexy host Nich Richardson, and features fresh young, trusted, good looking, reporters.
