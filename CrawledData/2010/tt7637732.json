An age-old political enmity divided rural Mexico into two sectors: one, governed by conservatives from Mexico City, and the other, governed by constitutional president Benito Juárez from the port of Veracruz. Upon consummating the War of Reform, the military triumph of the liberals validated this once polemic constitution, as well as the Laws of Reform, thus burying the secular hegemony of the Church and giving way to the modern lay State we have today.",
