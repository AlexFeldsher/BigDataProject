Having graduated law school with little effort due to her superb memory and high intelligence, Ma Hye Ri has little on her mind at her graduation ceremony but the high-end fashion show going on at the same time. Escaping the ceremony in favor of skiing and shopping, she has no idea that her weekend of frivolity will set off a chain of events that will change her life forever. Forced to become a prosecutor at the insistence of her wealthy father, she appears knowledgeable but unsympathetic to her new co-workers. Meanwhile, mysterious lawyer Seo In Woo takes her under his wing and helps the princess learn a thing or two about compassion in her work. Meanwhile, educated prosecutor Yoon Se Joon begins to fall for her, but In Woo is always beside her-until Hye Ri begins to question what his motives are. Prosecutor Princess stars Kim So Yeon ( Iris ) and Park Shi Hoo, rapidly-rising star of Family's Honor and Iljimae .",

            "The writer of 2009 hit Shining Inheritance adds a romantic comedy twist to this traditional revenge story. Having graduated law school with little effort due to her superb memory and high intelligence, Ma Hye Ri has little on her mind at her graduation ceremony but the high-end fashion show going on at the same time. Escaping the ceremony in favor of skiing and shopping, she has no idea that her weekend of frivolity will set off a chain of events that will change her life forever. Forced to become a prosecutor at the insistence of her wealthy father, she appears knowledgeable but unsympathetic to her new co-workers. Meanwhile, mysterious lawyer Seo In Woo takes her under his wing and helps the princess learn a thing or two about compassion in her work. Meanwhile, educated prosecutor Yoon Se Joon begins to fall for her, but In Woo is always beside her-until Hye Ri begins to question what his motives are. _Prosecutor Princess_ (qv) stars Kim So Yeon ( Iris ) and Park Shi Hoo, rapidly-rising star of Family's Honor and Iljimae ."
