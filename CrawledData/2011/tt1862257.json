With jobs scarce and cardboard plentiful, he takes to the streets to try his luck at \"hand outs\" after meeting Charles, a seemingly successful street dwelling scam artist. Trying to keep his job a secret from his loving but vacant mother is hard enough, but as he and Charles vie for the public's donations using every ploy in their arsenal they can muster from tap dancing to dog tricks, Benny begins to realize that his new cardboard life is just as full of hard knocks.",
