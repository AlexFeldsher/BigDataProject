            "In 2149, earth is nearly wrecked by pollution. Police detective Jim Shannon is jailed for illegally raising an extra child, Zoe. He's sprung from jail just in time to join his family on the latest 'pilgrimage', through a unique time-space-continuum rip, to _Terra Nova_ (qv), a colony run with modern technology in a dino age forest. Colony commander Nathaniel Taylor soon recruits as security professional Jim, who gradually finds out about some threats, notably from Saurian monsters, the 'sixers' and his own, bitterly estranged son Lucas. Meanwhile Jim's son Josh keeps getting into trouble, mainly due to his girlfriend Skye. His smart sister Maddy is in love with gentleman soldier Mark Reynolds.::KGF Vissers",

A new project called \"_Terra Nova_ (qv)\" was created to try and re-establish colonization in prehistoric times, and a family that broke the law for having three children escape to the _Terra Nova_ (qv) to restart their lives. Yet there's one problem... Hungry dinosaurs that wanna eat you!::ksnyder19",
            "From executive producers Steven Spielberg Peter Chernin, René Echevarria and Brannon Braga comes an epic family adventure 85 million years in the making. _Terra Nova_ (qv) follows an ordinary family on an incredible journey back in time to prehistoric Earth as a small part of a daring experiment to save the human race. In the year 2149, the world is dying. The planet is overdeveloped and overcrowded, with the majority of plant and animal life extinct. The future of mankind is in jeopardy, and its only hope for survival is in the distant past. When scientists at the FERMI Particle Accelerator unexpectedly discovered a fracture in time that made it possible to construct a portal into primeval history, the bold notion was born to resettle humanity in the past - a second chance to rebuild civilization and get it right this time.::ahmetkozan"
