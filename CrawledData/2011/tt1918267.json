            "In the genre of Saturday Night Live and the Chappelle's Show, So Damn Funny Show is a sketch comedy variety show written and created by Addison LeMay and Eduardo Avila. With a cast of wonderfully talented actors who bring zany ideas to life and make viewers laugh uncontrollably.\n\"Why Jews Rule The World\"- is an old Jewish anecdote some might call a joke, of how we Jews turn nothing into something.\n\"Addison's Program for Incontinent Employees\" -A workplace where people will never have to stop working to run to the bathroom.\n\"Pre-Wife Boot Camp\" -A Place where men can finally send their women to learn the skill necessary to be proper wives.\n\"Outsourced 911\"- When the 911 call center gets outsourced to India, cultural differences and communication problems cause mayhem.\n\"Chippys\"- The happiest place in the world. A restaurant where customers get much more than planned. \"Pussy Power\"- Do women really need money or cars when they go out? Not when they use their power.\n\"The Writers Meeting\"- Based on a true story. When we started SDFS we advertised for writers and met with every escapee from lunatic asylums from across the world. We show it here."
