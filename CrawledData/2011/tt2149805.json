In the thrilling ride of Season 1, Nat Cat and Pauly, as they are affectionately known to each other, traverse the volatile terrain of what to have for dinner, which print to buy from the supacentre and who's in charge of cheese and dips for Saturday's barbecue. Married life becomes very boring very quickly. In the midst of their hectic lives as newlyweds, even 'naughty time' takes a backseat.",
