Lee Sin's father, Lee Hyun Soo was a popular guitarist during his time but is now in the verge of death because of drug addiction; which was also the cause of his seperation with Song Ji Yeong (Lee Sin's mother) a long time ago. The female lead, Lee Gyo Won's grandfather, Lee Dong-jin is one of the top 3 traditional musicians of his age and his biggest wish is to see his granddaughter become a traditional music progidy. He is strictly against modern music because he believes that it misleads the tradition. The high school comes up with \"The 100th Year Anniversary\" where students get the opportunity to show their skill. Now, will Lee Sin be able to prove his skill in modern music like his father did? And will Lee Gyo Won be able to keep up her grandfather's expectations? Or something else is waiting for her over there?",
