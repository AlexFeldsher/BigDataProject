The other's a former city slicker who's learning the ropes. Together they are running a business uniquely suited for the swamp - where wild animals rule. From pythons and gators to bobcats and black bears - these guys encounter it all. Stephen and Robbie Keszey run Glades Herp Farms, Florida's largest reptile sanctuary and exotic reptile dealership. Their farm also houses Florida's International Teaching Zoo. The Zoo is full of rare species from around the globe and brings in a constant stream of new and different animals each month. The brothers make their living breeding and caring for hundreds of slithering, poisonous and sharp-toothed creatures, but their passion is being on call 24 hours a day to respond to animal emergencies across the vast state of Florida.",

            "Way down south is a place that was once thought to be a dismal land fit only for alligators and snakes. It's wet, it's dangerous and it's weird. Which means it's perfect for one of the most unique family businesses in the country. Meet a different breed of brothers. One's an animal expert. The other's a former city slicker who's learning the ropes. Together they are running a business uniquely suited for the swamp - where wild animals rule. From pythons and gators to bobcats and black bears - these guys encounter it all. Stephen and Robbie Keszey run Glades Herp Farms, Florida's largest reptile sanctuary and exotic reptile dealership. Their farm also houses Florida's International Teaching Zoo. The Zoo is full of rare species from around the globe and brings in a constant stream of new and different animals each month. The brothers make their living breeding and caring for hundreds of slithering, poisonous and sharp-toothed creatures, but their passion is being on call 24 hours a day to respond to animal emergencies across the vast state of Florida.::Discovery Channel"
