This brings him to the middle of one of the biggest projects in US history, the building of the transcontinental railroad. After the war years in the 1860s, this undertaking connected the prospering east with the still wild west.::cc ardbeg",
            "The show introduces real characters such as Thomas Durant, who was responsible for building the railroad from east to west. Bohannon may be the main character, but his adventures are cleverly woven amid real historical events and issues. There were hostilities among whites and recently freed slaves working on the rail line. There were also difficulties with the Irish crews, who weren't considered to be too much better, during those times. Of course there were also conflicts with Indians, who resented the crossing of their territory with total disregard of their sacred places. And of course there are difficulties with the building of the railroad itself, weather problems, difficult terrain, cheating officials, and late payrolls. Also shows the difficult lives of women in the era.::b gibson"
