            "What shall I name this love? It is not a Love-Hate story. It is Love and pretend to be hate story. Arnav and Khushi always express their love with the help of a emotion so called as ANGER. Both are extremely opposite in all the values and cultures yet they fall for each other. They pretend like they hate each other but originally they love each other a lot.::Arshi",
            "What should i name this love? This show is all about love. The love for siblings,parents,god,food and yes between couples who are madly in love but not realizing it. Arnav Singh Raizada a diabetic patient who was an Atheist and only speaks with the power of money and was totally rude more with his life than others because of some bad past experience as he was an orphan and on the other hand Khushi Kumari Gupta was a Theist and her words are very sweet as jalebi, her fav sweet she too was an orphan but she lived with her aunt and uncle. They both were totally different from each other. Whenever they talk Khushi tries to make him understand that love is bigger than your money but Arnav always tries to prove that nothing is bigger than money. They both fight with each other all the time when they are close but when they are far from each other they always think about each other. And after lots of issues at time of Payal, Khushi's sister, and Akash, Arnav cousin wedding they both realize their love for each other but due to some family misunderstanding Arnav starts hating Khushi for the crime she has no done but after some dramatic episodes he realises his love again and live happily ever after. The most amazing part of this series is that if the love between partners is true then you can even feel each others presence as they do. And love can reduce anyone to anything. They hate each other so much that they can't come close to each other, But they love each other so much that they can't live without each other.",
