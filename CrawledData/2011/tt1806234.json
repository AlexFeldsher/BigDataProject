            "Like all life forms, humanity partially adapts to types of natural environment, yet also tends to change them. Each episode examines how life differs for men and nature in some type of environment, from Arctic to desert and jungle, from coasts to mountains.::KGF Vissers",
            "Humans are the most resourceful members of the animal kingdom, having spread across six continents and being able to adapt to any environment. From the frigid wastes of the Arctic Circle, to the jungles of Southeast Asia and urban metropolises like New York, this series documents how humans live in different habitats and interact with the natural world.::Tom Daly"

Here you will meet people who survive by building complex, exciting and often mutually beneficial relationships with their animal neighbours and the hostile elements of the natural world.Human Planet crews have filmed in around 80 locations, bringing you many stories that have never been told on television before. The team has trekked with HD cameras and state of the art gear to film from the air, from the ground and underwater.
