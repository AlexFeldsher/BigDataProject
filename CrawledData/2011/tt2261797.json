It, however, marked the beginning of a global power struggle between the two factions, which would be better known as the Cold War. Because the Americans had the ultimate weapon of annihilation in the nuclear bomb, that power struggle was largely through public relation campaigns, in among other propaganda battlegrounds as the Italian election following the war, in Berlin as Stalin and the ...

As such, the Soviet regime banned something they thought was uniquely American: jazz music. But the new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, wanted to show the world that his country was not as repressive as many in the west believed. So he hosted the World Youth Festival in Moscow in 1957, inviting youth from around the world to have a basically western styled party. This opened the ...    "
