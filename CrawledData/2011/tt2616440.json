Although filled with constant bickering, G&B Monster Agency runs like a well-oiled machine. Positions are understood and Go's leadership is almost always filtered by Voice-Box and questioned by Piper. It's clockwork, childish and bizarre clockwork, but clockwork none-the-less. But when Luke, a 25-year-old orphan joins the trio's ranks in hopes of avenging his monster-murdered father, the team's chemistry is quickly thrown out of whack and their faltering creditability takes a steep nose-dive. To make matters worse, the team must also deal with Police Chief Frank Sargeant, a man hell bent on discrediting the team and having them exiled from their hometown of Bith County. Yet, in the face of their personal predicaments and the seemingly endless hordes of various monsters, Go, Voice-Box, Piper and Luke are always the ones willing to answer the call. I Kill Monsters is ultimately the comical underdog story of four social outcasts who have finally found their place in the world, and in a world this strange; they may be our only hope.
