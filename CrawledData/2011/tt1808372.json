He is friend, counselor and savior to the rural unemployed and destitute. He invites drifters into his troupe and employs and mentors young people to keep them off drugs.

An 80-year iconic Australian tradition will come to an end. But Fred wants to go out with a bang. He plans to make the last tour his best ever and an unforgettable experience for both his boxers and the audiences in the towns he visits.",
