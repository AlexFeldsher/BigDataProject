Will she discover happiness and new experiences, or will the dice lead her to ruin? This documentary covers her experiences throughout the process. Dice living, also known as dice-living, dicing, or die-ing is a way of life made popular by the semi-fictional novel \"The Dice Man\" (1971). The book follows the adventures of Luke Rhinehart, a man who embraces risk and throws dice to make decisions about all things, including thoughts, actions, and emotions. The concept is to decide on six possible outcomes or choices, listing them from one to six, or odds and evens for a simple yes/no. The answer is decided by the roll of the dice, and most importantly, the dice must always be obeyed no matter what the outcome.",
