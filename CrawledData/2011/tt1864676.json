But the Humfreys also share their home with a few other pets - more than 2000 and each one of them needs care and attention 24/7. This isn't your average family home. It's a private zoo where human and animal sagas unfold on a daily basis. Chris and his wife Nicole work around the clock to keep their very extended family happy and healthy and manage their enthusiastic crew of Gen Y zookeepers/presenters. Each week Chris will share with us this extraordinary life and his amazing knowledge of Australia's fauna. Follow Chris in this chaotic, animal-crazy series that captures the drama, the danger, the animal antics and the sheer exhilaration of Chris Humfrey's Wild Life. Every day, a new saga unfolds at the zoo. Every day there is something new to learn - even for Chris.",
