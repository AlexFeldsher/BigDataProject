            "Kate Reed (Sarah Shahi) is a firm believer that justice can always be found--even if it's not always in the courtroom. Once a lawyer at her family's esteemed San Francisco firm, Kate's frustration with the legal system led her to a new career as a mediator. Thanks to her innate understanding of human nature, thorough legal knowledge, and winning smile, Kate is a natural when it comes to dispute resolution. Except, it seems, when it comes to conflicts in her own life.Kate clashes constantly with her partners at Reed & Reed, steely stepmother Lauren (Virginia Williams) and ambitious up-and-coming attorney Ben (Ryan Johnson), the latest addition to the firm. And her personal life is no less complicated, thanks to an on-again, off-again relationship with ex-husband Justin (Michael Trucco), a San Francisco ADA. Luckily, Kate's got her resourceful assistant Leo (Baron Vaughn) to back her up, and enough energy and determination to face just about any conflict, no matter how unconventional--or even impossible--it may seem.\n"
