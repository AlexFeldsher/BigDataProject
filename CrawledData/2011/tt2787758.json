Apollo is a man stuck in the past with hopes for the present, peddling the last legal drug inside an establishment which similarly to himself was once upon a time hip and popular but now is forgotten. Apollo's Pad has become a safe-haven to losers, the less fortunate looking to the even less fortunate, where ignorance leads to unpredictable events and hysterical stories. The variety of patrons is limitless, however in few numbers, the schemes are endless, however never successful and the content unrated but never profound. This is Apollo's Pad on the surface, what lies beneath the cigarette buts and spilt booze is the story of a modern black family, fighting the odds, struggling to remain selfishly together and make a buck while the modern world and it's tempting surroundings tries to tear them and their bar apart... oh, and they're puppets!",
