They laugh until they cry, finish each other's sentences and feel entitled to have an opinion about every detail of each other's lives. Things may get hectic between work, golf outings, shuttling the kids to soccer practice in their Jimmy Choos, and marriage counseling for some, but they can't imagine going a day without talking. And if they're not talking to each other, they're talking about each other. The term 'mind your own business' has no place in a Marino household because your business is everyone's business. They're each others best friends and worst critics, but they always have each other's backs because in the Marino family blood is definitely thicker than water.",
