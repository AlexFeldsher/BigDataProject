In order to be a good captain, Li Chishui tries everything from enhancing trainings to recruiting new members. Thanks to his efforts, his battalion gradually develops. When Japanese army sweeps the Northern China area, Li Chishui's battalion is assigned to delay an elite troop of over 30,000 Japanese soldiers at all costs so that the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army will have time to transfer. Before he accepts this essential task, Li Chishui makes a request: he wants an official designation for his battalion. After making this request, Li Chishui leads his battalion to the front, devoting their lives to this task. The battalion sticks to the battlefield for several days until they all have nothing to fight with and die in the battle. One month later, the CPC cadre who assigns this task to Li Chishui's battalion returns to this battlefield. Facing the tombs of all the soldiers, he fulfills his promise to Li Chishui and grants Li Chishui's battalion a designation. He says, \"They defend the dignity of The Eighth Route Army with their lives. Today, I award them this designation which will last forever! For China, we will fight any enemy until we drain every drop of our blood.\"",
