Although most people who find themselves in these horrific situations do not live to tell their story, there are some who miraculously manage to survive. Each episode of The Indestructibles takes a 360 degree look at the science of surviving an extreme disaster. Through cutting-edge CGI, breathtaking footage and reenactments, National Geographic uncovers the hard and fast science behind some of the most amazing survival stories of our time.",

            "It is the stuff nightmares are made of: a skydiver loses his parachute and crashes into a high-voltage power line, a speeding car slams into a father holding his four month-old infant, and a giant wave knocks a man off a cliff and into an underwater cave . Although most people who find themselves in these horrific situations do not live to tell their story, there are some who miraculously manage to survive. Each episode of _The Indestructibles_ (qv) takes a 360 degree look at the science of surviving an extreme disaster. Through cutting-edge CGI, breathtaking footage and reenactments, National Geographic uncovers the hard and fast science behind some of the most amazing survival stories of our time."
