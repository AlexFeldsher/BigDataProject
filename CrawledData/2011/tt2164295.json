But Friday was not supposed to be a gift from the sky, he was supposed to belong to Fred's neighbor, secret Agent Brains, who works for the intergalactic safety organization called The Protectors. Brains disguises herself as a regular awkward girl named Braianna, while saving the world from alien invasions, escaped bug populations, Sewer Bears, and other mysteries.
