You're invited along to meet the wild people, to live their stories, connect to the untouched land and unspoiled nature - the remarkable things you never knew such a journey could entail. From stalking bighorn sheep in the Rockies, competing with the wolves for caribou in the high Arctic, and run-ins with massive moose in Newfoundland...if the challenge is there, so is The EDGE. The EDGE is a hunter's ultimate pursuit to push his limits to conquest over nature or face defeat.",
