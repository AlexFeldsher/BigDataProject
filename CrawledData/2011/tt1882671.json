        "plot outline": "\"La La Land\" is about about two bumbling fools, Donnie and Kevin. Donnie, 22, and Kevin, 23, are best-friend-losers that do nothing with themselves everyday. The only joy and excitement either of them shares day in day out is playing on their video game consoles. Each lives at home very contently with no urgency to leave. Donnie, with his Grandmother and her cat, Kevin with his father and sister in the same neighborhood. Donnie with a stroke of luck catches a celebrity in a compromising position. Feeling like he can make a quick two or three hundred bucks he snaps a photo on his phone. With no experience or knowledge of what to do with the photo he takes the photo to his best friend Kevin, who suggests taking the photo to TMZ. When they arrive at TMZ, the boys make a pact that the photo will be sold for nothing less than 300 dollars. Once they get in front of Tammy, the head honcho at TMZ, and do a little negotiating they end up selling the photo for 60,000 dollars. Shocked and excited they debate over what to do with the money. Donnie feels it should be invested and put away into an investment account at the bank but Kevin has other ideas. He wants to blow the money on any and everything. Kevin makes a rash decision and decides to rent a lavish penthouse on the beach in Malibu and surprises Donnie. Donnie infuriated tells him he wants no part of it but Kevin convinces him that the lavish life is the perfect life. He tells him the way they can continue this lifestyle is by becoming full time paparazzi photographers, as he presents Donnie with his very own still camera. They begin right away since they have an expensive apartment with no furniture, food, or necessities. They try Hollywood hot spot The Ivy to capture celebrities. In the chaotic scene Donnie breaks his camera and has second doubts about whether or not they should be involved in this profession. However, Kevin gets a shot and head back to TMZ. When they get there and meet with Tammy, she nearly kicks them out on the street after she explains to them that the picture they're trying to sell her has been in her hands since nearly an hour prior to them meeting with her. However she Tammy takes notice to tenacity she sees in Donnie and Kevin's eyes and she decides to cut them a break and make them a deal. She tells them she'll take them under her wing and show them the ropes of the business in exchange for them submitting photos to her, and only her. They agree to her conditions and take her advice. The boys sneak up a mountainside and onto the property of a celebrity in the Hollywood Hills, snapping photos of her looking very unattractive. After being spotted they try to escape, Donnie gets side blinded by security but not before handing the camera off to Kevin who escapes from the scene. Kevin bails Donnie out of jail in and tells them how much money they made for the ph oto he so heroically got. Kevin asks him if it was worth it and Donnie looking around at the newly bought expensive plasma television with games consoles lined up underneath expresses \"yes\" as they both smile.",
