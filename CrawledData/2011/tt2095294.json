At the end of each party, each guest rates the party on a scale of one to ten inclusive. Each guest can use whatever criteria he/she deems important to rate the party, the quality of the food only being one possible factor. At the end of the last party, the host of that party gets the voting results, which he/she reads to the other competitors. The competitor with the highest score wins 1,000 Lt. By the end of the last party, each competitor gets to know their fellow competitors a little better. Some may become friends for life, while others wish they had never met",
