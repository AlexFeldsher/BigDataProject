In 1512, the Medici family regained power in Florence and Machiavelli was accused of conspiracy, arrested and tortured. With the intension of bringing him back into favour with the Medici family, Machiavelli then wrote 'The Prince', a guide to creating and holding on to a principality. Due to his controversial statements favouring a lasting regime over noble ideals, Machiavelli came to be widely regarded as the Devil's servant. 'The Prince' has become the bible of real politics.
