Realizing that they're responsible for the leaks, the three kids, along with their friend Angie, join forces in the real world to defend their town and put the nefarious leaks back into the computer world where they belong. All the while, the kids must continue to deal with the reality of being high school students, build their friendships and try their best to keep their creature-fighting activities a secret from everyone around them."
