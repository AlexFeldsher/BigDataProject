Pauly, on the other hand, has an unending stream of ideas for the shop. If only he weren't incredibly stupid, a few of them might be good!Unfortunately for Ben, he's stuck with Pauly's well-meaning involvement due to some financial aid; and his own ex-wife, Liza, is ever keen to recoup some of the money she put into the store too!The pair are ably assisted in the store by Eastern European employee Katia, probably the most intelligent of the lot of them, and hire a former shoplifter, Toby, as their security guard. But it's not going to be easy to get the money flowing..."
