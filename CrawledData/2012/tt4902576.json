It reveals the drama, lies, love triangles, and infidelity found among some of the highest, well known public figures in the area. The Elam Marshal Community Center serves as a positive getaway to many troubled teens in the Triangle. It's evident that the staff's main goal is the well-being of the occupants, but what happens when the staff of such a highly notable center has secrets of their own? After being handed the title of Director of the Elam Marshal Community Center by her now sickened Mom, Allie is faced with a host of decisions. ? Her marriage with the town's most well- known attorney, Rick Gray, is crumbling. Her baby brother is a hopeless victim to gambling. Her Mom is deathly ill, and due to the poor conditions of the center, the state is now threatening to close its doors forever. Allie is determined to keep her Mother's name alive, by keeping the center open, however Rick feels that the low-budgeted establishment is nothing more than a bottomless, hopeless money pit. It isn't until Rick discovers that Allie has been secretly taking thousands of dollars from their personal account each month to keep the center open that he decides to take matters into his own hands, and do whatever it takes to diminish the existence of the center. He is determined to accomplish this at whatever risk necessary, even if it means sacrificing the safety of his family, or the promises made during his vows.",
