When he starts to fixate on his insecurities about past success and his secret tendencies to dress up in his wife's designer clothing, writer's block sets in. Procrastination, pot and fashion fill his days until he gets some needed encouragement from an unlikely source. This witty short is a beautiful portrait of acceptance from outside and in.    "
