Plante to leave the big city and drown his sorrows in a small but quickly-developing town of Brenford East Shamsbury. The place seems innocent enough at first, with your typical cast of quirky and close characters: A young money developer buying up the towns farms; The Richest man in town who owns the golf course and his sultry daughter; A farm girl-next-door; and a trio of cops who can barely keep up with the town's growth. Upon his first night in Brenford a note is slipped under his door beckoning him to a home address. He ignores the note only to come accross a B&E investigation at the address the next morning. Now recognized by the helpless cops as a revered detective, and heavily implicated in a potential crime, Richard feels obligated, and a little curious, to follow through and solve this curious series of events. Richard uncovers blackmail, offshore accounts, unlikely relations, and a greedy plot that are en route to an inevitably violent end. With the help of the local law enforcement, his own gut, and a little gossip-digging, Richard snoops, gumshoe, and drinks his way to the bottom of the truth.",
