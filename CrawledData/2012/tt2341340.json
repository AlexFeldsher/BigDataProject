            "\"In this world of uncertainty, would we be happier if we could predict the future...?\"What would you do if all of your dreams had a way of coming true...including nightmares? Beautiful and young, Ayami has a solid reputation as a dedicated and reliable elementary teacher, but her true character is solely clandestine. Ayami does not believe in love and trust, and her values make her oblivious to other peoples matters. Almost devious, she is always scheming so she never has to deal with responsibility and troubles that spur around her. One day, a new student Yuiko enrolls in her home-room class. It does not take long for Ayami to find out that Yuiko has an ability to predict the future through the dreams she sees in her sleep; dreams which are symbolic and require proper interpretation to understand the upcoming occurrences. But when Yuiko begins to have nightmares of people around them, Ayami, though unwillingly, must team up with Yuiko to try to change the tragic fate of those around them... But can they properly assess what Yuikos nightmares truly mean and change what may already be destined?Akumu-chan is a family drama enjoyable from kids to adults, packed with excitement and fun fantastic visuals with a pinch of humor that shows how Ayami learns the true meaning of life. Each episode will transport the viewer to a bizarre and seemingly paranormal dream world that is a fantasy-filled treat to the eye and an oneirocritical ride for the mind! --NTV"
