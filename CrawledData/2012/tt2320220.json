Nanami accepted his offer and went to his place. It was the shrine of Mikage and there she met fox yokai Tomoe who is the familiar in shrine. He refuses to become her familiar and vanishes, deciding instead to give himself over to a life of sloth, drink and debauchery. However, in the world \"over yonder\" things rarely go to plan, and through desperation and cleverness, Nanami succeeds in tricking Tomoe and binding him to her service."
