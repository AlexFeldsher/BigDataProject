The other main characters on the show include Adam and Joe's boss Lance Rockett (a cross-dressing 54 year old lead singer for a Van Halen tribute band still living the 80s glam metal lifestyle) and Adam's imaginary friend Oderus Urungus (an alien who lives in his closet and advises him on his life... badly).
