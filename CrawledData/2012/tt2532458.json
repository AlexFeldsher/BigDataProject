        "plot outline": "What teenager has never dreamed of stepping onto a stage and show everyone his or her talent? Talent High School is the place where dreams become reality. Acting, fashion, singing and dancing are the main subjects taught at this highly exclusive school where no one needs to be \"normal.\" However, they do need certain calling cards to gain access to it: attendance at equally exclusive schools and overseas experiences. As good at dancing, Sofia is just the daughter of a mechanic in the suburbs, virtually self-taught, and, as a result, is not accepted at the academy. Then, she pretends to be Allegra De Magistriis, the daughter of a Hollywood producer, born and raised like a star and who just happens to be Sofia's drop of water. Lying is not so easy, especially with people who were really born in that world. In fact, who really does not take anything to discover his secret is Bart, a talented but unbearable dancer, son of a record producer, who enjoys to see Sofia turn pale at his discovery. But Sofia is not intimidated, because, despite his talent, Bart has a totally different passion: the engine, just the one in which Sofia has been surrounded by since she was a little girl. Between one argument and the next, Sofia and Bart will make a pact: a collaboration that will bring them closer and closer to the realization of their dreams. Sofia/Allegra's companions at the Talent High School, apart from Bart, are Marion, the principal's snob daughter, Greta, a rather extravagant aspiring writer, Greg, an aspiring fashion designer with the air of a nerd, and, later, Patrick, a handsome DJ.",

            "What teenager has never dreamed of stepping onto a stage and show everyone his or her talent? Talent High School is the place where dreams become reality. Acting, fashion, singing and dancing are the main subjects taught at this highly exclusive school where no one needs to be \"normal.\" However, they do need certain calling cards to gain access to it: attendance at equally exclusive schools and overseas experiences. As good at dancing, Sofia is just the daughter of a mechanic in the suburbs, virtually self-taught, and, as a result, is not accepted at the academy. Then, she pretends to be Allegra De Magistriis, the daughter of a Hollywood producer, born and raised like a star and who just happens to be Sofia's drop of water. Lying is not so easy, especially with people who were really born in that world. In fact, who really does not take anything to discover his secret is Bart, a talented but unbearable dancer, son of a record producer, who enjoys to see Sofia turn pale at his discovery. But Sofia is not intimidated, because, despite his talent, Bart has a totally different passion: the engine, just the one in which Sofia has been surrounded by since she was a little girl. Between one argument and the next, Sofia and Bart will make a pact: a collaboration that will bring them closer and closer to the realization of their dreams. Sofia/Allegra's companions at the Talent High School, apart from Bart, are Marion, the principal's snob daughter, Greta, a rather extravagant aspiring writer, Greg, an aspiring fashion designer with the air of a nerd, and, later, Patrick, a handsome DJ.::MBJQE"
