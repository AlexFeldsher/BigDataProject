Back home, she's going to use all of her energy and experience to help a Mamasan Korus called \"Chansons\" from having to break up. In order to do that, she modifies the concept of a chorus by adding dancing to their performance. Naturally, this idea isn't going well with everyone in the chorus, especially one very conservative housewife (Ishida) aggressively opposes her unconventional ideas.",

            "Amami's character is going to be that of a legendary musical star who just returned to Japan after several setbacks on the Broadway in New York. Back home, she's going to use all of her energy and experience to help a Mamasan Korus called \"Chansons\" from having to break up. In order to do that, she modifies the concept of a chorus by adding dancing to their performance. Naturally, this idea isn't going well with everyone in the chorus, especially one very conservative housewife (Ishida) aggressively opposes her unconventional ideas.::https://mydramalist.com/3960-kaeru-no-oujo-sama"
