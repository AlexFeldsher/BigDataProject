But how will this affect her relationship with her very successful but incredibly clueless fiance, John? And does she really want to abandon her comfortable life to become the front-woman for The Cake Boyz rap group, who just got dropped from their label? Meanwhile, Farrah's inner circle--comprised of a celebrity-obsessed, drunkard sister, Ava, her ex-coke addict friend Hannah, and her bff aka the sole voice of reason, Lesile--help her navigate these important life decisions with their own two cents."
