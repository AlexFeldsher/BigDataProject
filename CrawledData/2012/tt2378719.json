The series provides a voyeuristic look into the lives of a group of twentysomething friends whose once rock-solid friendships have been torn apart by betrayal. The borough of Brooklyn provides a scenic and energetic backdrop to an authentic story of friendship, love and family. Much of the activity takes place in the diverse and increasingly affluent, but still traditional, community of Bay Ridge, a destination for many young people in that part of Brooklyn due to its vibrant collection of shops, restaurants, and bars. It is the place where the kids hang out, unwind and where one of the cast members works. While Bay Ridge was made famous by the 1977 movie \"Saturday Night Fever,\" the community has come a long way since the days of Tony Manero. With strong community roots, Bay Ridge is a destination for many from near and far. But all of these neighborhoods have common themes; it's the bonds of loyalty, respect and family. Vividly shot in a lush documentary style that showcases the urban streetscapes of Brooklyn, \"Brooklyn 11223\" reveals a story featuring two former best friends, one of whom might have betrayed the bonds of friendship by seducing the other's boyfriend.",
