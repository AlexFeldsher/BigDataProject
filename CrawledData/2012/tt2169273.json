            "In this character-viewer interactive mockumentary, Indie runs a trans-media music news company where the entire staff goes by the name of the genre they follow the stereotype of. Indie is the hipster boss who sends posers to giant rats, Hip Hop is the head of marketing who is far from a Hip Hop stereotype, Metal is the head banging head of production with a teenage daughter and a pregnant wife, Idol is the social media guru obsessed with One Direction and Justin Bieber, Scarfman is a pile of scarves who looks like a guy, Techno and Dubstep are the ravers who can't go an hour without dancing, Scene is the hyperactive intern who is clearly not emo and obsessed with Indie, and Intern 2 is... just that, he's also friends with Hip Hop. Together they struggle with fire safety, secretive websites, controversial videos, and spies for horrible artists."
