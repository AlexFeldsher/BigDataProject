        "synopsis": [
            "Bent follows Alex (Amanda Peet) and Pete (David Walton), two couples who find themselves attracted to each others traits that would normally derail them from moving forward. Alex is a recently divorcee who works as a lawyer. She and her 8-year-old daughter Charlie (Joey King) live together trying to save money by moving into a smaller home. When she hires Pete as a contractor to remodel her kitchen,they share a connection that is attractive to both of them. An irresponsible womanizer, Pete is trying to rebuild his contracting career after ruining it with his promiscuous ways and addiction to gambling. The highly strung Alex, whose husband was sent to prison for insider trading, is trying to maintain a busy work schedule while raising her daughter. Aware of his reputation with women, Alex insists she will fire Pete if he presents any problems. Other cast members include Alex's flirty sister Screwsie (Margo Harshman), Pete's aspiring musician father Walt (Jeffrey Tambor), Charlie's babysitter Simone (Susan Park) and Pete's contractor crew (Bert Belasco, Rick Gonzalez and Pasha D. Lychnikoff)."
