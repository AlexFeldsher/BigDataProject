Alex leads a fugitive case and crosses paths with a former geneticist, but now convicted felon Jesse Sinclair, who was once an integral part of the plot against Alex, but has now been cast out of the organization, discredited and humiliated in front of his former peers. Alex and his partner Samantha Baine are on the trail of a man named Darren Anderson, a powerful person with whom Sinclair is very familiar and whom he fears. Sinclair knows about Alex's past, his divorce, the death of his son, and how his life has spiraled out of control since searching for Anderson. On the hunt for Alex is an ex-military Special Forces veteran, Carter Bell, who now heads a government sanctioned private military agency. Bell, instrumental in causing the death of Alex's son, is relentless and will stop at nothing to capture Alex, even killing those that stand in his way. Those that are not killed are simply REPLACED. Now on the run with his own longtime partner Sam hunting him, Alex must unravel the plot against him, clear his name, and find the elusive architect behind this massive conspiracy that reaches the highest levels he didn't think possible.",
