        "synopsis": [
            "Sean Rich, a former recurring expert on Pawn Stars, branches off into his own series for the National Geographic Channel. Sean and his team of experts travel all over the United States appraising antique military weapons for auction. The weapons can include guns, cannons, swords, axes, etc. Some weapons are determined to be fakes, or are just in such bad condition that they won't even accept them for the auction. Meanwhile, other weapons are tested to see if they can still fire. If they do still fire, the working theory is that they will get more money for it at the auction. For the weapons that are chosen for the auction, Sean or one his experts will give a guaranteed dollar amount that they believe they will get for it. If they hit the amount, Team Rich gets a 15% commission fee. If they don't hit that number, the fee is waived. Each episode closes with the auction where audience members are bidding in-person, on the telephone, or over the internet. Sean is the third Pawn Stars expert to get his own series, following Rick Dale with American Restoration and Danny Koker with Counting Cars. However, this is the first spin-off that is not on the History Channel."
