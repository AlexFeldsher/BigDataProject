D is a story about a charming, under-qualified teacher trying to fake his way through a teaching job, just like he often fakes his way through life. The premise shines the light on teaching from the teachers point of view, and as it turns out, teachers dont know everything, especially Mr. D who struggles to keep one step ahead of his students."
