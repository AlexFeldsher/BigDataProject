        "synopsis": [
            "Who knew that the park could be such an alienating yet steamy meat market? Well, sure enough, it is, as illustrated in this fresh little story, which depicts the misadventures of the 'creepy guy' as he endures the perils of modern dating in a suburban park near Los Angeles. He is oblivious to all the rejections he experiences from the numerous women he approaches: what he lacks in sophistication, he makes up for in denial. While he stubbornly attempts to seduce women who turn him down repeatedly, some couples break up, some hook up, and some reconcile as they exercise or simply sway on the swings of the park. There is a potential silver lining to this story: the creepy guy is obviously not discouraged by multiple dating rejections and will likely continue his quest for romance; such optimism could be eventually rewarded. We will never know but cannot stop watching..."
