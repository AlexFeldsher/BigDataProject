        "synopsis": [
            "A favorite with viewers, news anchor Will McAvoy has found a safe niche with\nbankable ratings on his 8:00 p.m. flagship cable show, News Night. Numbed by\nsuccess, McAvoy has become stoic, complacent, cynical content not to rock the boat as\nhe delivers the nightly news straight down the middle of the road dialing it in as he\navoids ruffling feathers with anything resembling politics. What fire he still has, he\nreserves for the cutting sarcasm and general unpleasantness that earn him no fans with\nhis news team.In a literal blink of an eye or perhaps an optical illusion McAvoy is catapulted\nfrom apathy to engagement when a spontaneous outburst leads him to tackle the\nprinciples of American patriotism in a public forum. Surviving the professional fallout from\nhis unexpected tirade following an enforced vacation, McAvoy returns to work to discover\nthat most of his staff has jumped ship for another show and is forced to work with several\nnew team members brought on board during his absence.McAvoys boss, Charlie Skinner, the unapologetically old-school president of\nACNs news division, laments the changing face of the news. Setting the stage for Wills\nreturn to the standard set by news legends such as Edward R. Murrow and Walter\nCronkite, Charlie covertly orchestrates the hiring of Wills new executive producer, the one\nperson who can restore Will's passion and bring the best out of him whether Will wants\nit or not.Wills new executive producer is MacKenzie McHale, back from 26 months\nembedded in Iraq and Afghanistan. MacKenzie was once romantically involved with Will\nand knows the idealism he has buried beneath a veneer of apathy and cynicism. With\ntheir shared past, she knows exactly how good he can be. Even more unsettling for him,\nshe challenges Will to abandon the successful, middle-of-the-road approach that has\nmade him so popular with both sides of the aisle, and realize his full potential by\ndelivering the news with integrity.Also imposed upon Will are Jim Harper, Margaret Jordan, Don Keefer, Neal\nSampat and Sloan Sabbith, the newsroom staff. Although this group finds itself off to a\ntumultuous start when breaking news comes over the wire, they immediately come\ntogether for one elusive goal: to do TV news well. Jim Harper is MacKenzies loyal senior\nshow producer. Though only 27 years old, Jim is more like the old-school reporter Charlie\nthan he is like his contemporaries. He finds himself instantly smitten with Margaret\nJordan, a young intern-turned-associated producer, who is already in a relationship with\nDon Keefer, Wills former executive producer. Neal Sampat, a young, resourceful selfmade\nnewsman writes Wills blog and scours the Internet for stories, often finding leads\nhis colleagues have missed. Sloan Sabbith is ACNs financial news analyst."
