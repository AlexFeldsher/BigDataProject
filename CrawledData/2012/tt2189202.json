Ironically it was precisely this spirit that had led to British art colleges contributing to pop music culture on a scale unmatched elsewhere. The new role of art schools as a social melting pot in the 1960s, and their policy that everyone had to study a broad-based arts curriculum before being allowed to specialise, resulted in a new cultural playground where musical passions and fresh ideas flourished.
