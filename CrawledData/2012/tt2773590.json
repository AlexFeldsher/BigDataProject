            "From the Grammy-Award-winning Radiohead music producer Nigel Godrich and Dilly Gent, Producer of the original 'From the Basement' series comes the third season of 'From the Basement' in 3D. Filmed on the historic Charlie Chaplin Stage in Hollywood, the hugely popular music programme captures intimate performances from some of today's finest artists including Foster the People, Scissor Sisters, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Moby. Viewers will also be introduced to an exciting array of new talent including Thundercat, Shearwater, and Delta Spirit. From the Basement started as a life podcast before making the leap to television and now, for the first time, to 3D. With no audience or host, it allows the artist to take centre stage and perform in intimate surroundings and without distraction. From the Basement allows music fans to enjoy their favorite artists with no interruptions and has been hailed as a modern take on the The Old Grey Whistle Test and Peel Sessions."
