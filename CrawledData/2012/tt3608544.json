But when Andy heads off to his workshop for his tea-break, an adventure is about to begin. In the workshop his ingenious friend Kip is always tinkering with her latest invention and, inspired by Andy's animal encounters, Kip and Andy decide it's time to go on an adventure to discover more. So it's all aboard the park buggy with Kip at the wheel. But this is no ordinary buggy. With the help of Kip's technical know-how it transforms into the most remarkable KipMobile, a high-spec, all-terrain, flying vehicle. From the jungles of Borneo to the Australian outback, Andy and Kip are on a mission to uncover the incredible wildlife that inhabits our planet. With a little help from Kip, Andy is able to shrink to the size of any animal he finds, allowing him to go on a journey where no adventurer has ever gone before.",
