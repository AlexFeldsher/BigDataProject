Yoo Eun-Jae, a bodyguard, defends her father using her Judo skills and throws Park Moo-Yeol to the ground. When the Red Dreamers find out a video of the incident has hit the Internet they decide that to prevent the negative publicity they will hire Yoo Eun-Jae to guard Park Moo-Yeol. This allows them to claim that the whole incident was merely practice and not the latest in a string of offences and embarrassments by Park Moo-Yeol. For the ploy to work under media attention however, Yoo Eun-Jae must actually perform as expected, in close attendance to Park Moo-Yeol. Thus the story plays out with Yoo Eun-Jae and Park Moo-Yeol battling not only each other, but a sinister stalker out to get the infamous Red Dreamer star Park Moo-Yeol.",

            "Late at night in a Karaoke bar, Yoo Eun-Jae's father sees the Red Dreamers Baseball player Park Moo-Yeol, who he blames for ruining his beloved Blue Seagulls chance at the Championship, and gets into a confrontation. Yoo Eun-Jae, a bodyguard, defends her father using her Judo skills and throws Park Moo-Yeol to the ground. When the Red Dreamers find out a video of the incident has hit the Internet they decide that to prevent the negative publicity they will hire Yoo Eun-Jae to guard Park Moo-Yeol. This allows them to claim that the whole incident was merely practice and not the latest in a string of offences and embarrassments by Park Moo-Yeol. For the ploy to work under media attention however, Yoo Eun-Jae must actually perform as expected, in close attendance to Park Moo-Yeol. Thus the story plays out with Yoo Eun-Jae and Park Moo-Yeol battling not only each other, but a sinister stalker out to get the infamous Red Dreamer star Park Moo-Yeol.::baby-luck"
