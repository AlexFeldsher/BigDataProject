Set in Kol's neighbourhood, Lonsdale Village, each day is a new adventure for Kol and his two best friends - a dog and a bird. Kol's family dog Terry, is an irrepressible Terrier puppy with boundless enthusiasm for exploring. Bella is a savvy songbird with a story to share and a song to sing. Together, Kol, Terry and Bella explore the neighborhood, and meet all the wonderful animals that live in their community. Whether it's a trip to the park or a visit to a local shop, along the way Kol learns a whole bunch about the world around him, the creatures that inhabit it and about himself! While KOL'S WORLD also deals with the physical challenges that Kol faces, the show is never 'just' about that. KOL'S WORLD is groundbreaking; our hero is a boy who loves to laugh and play - just like other boys and girls - Kol just happens to be in a wheelchair. Kol's disability is treated with openness and honesty, and all of our characters are fully aware of his condition. Along the way we have a fantastic opportunity to explore some great lessons about overcoming barriers, about willpower, and about changing attitudes. What really matters is that Kol faces each of life's obstacles with positive zeal, and that sure is inspiring! Children with disabilities will see themselves, and their stories, reflected back. Children without disabilities will get to meet a cool, funny hero who is differently-abled! The result? Fun, engaging and empowering stories and adventures about a REAL boy with remarkable friends!",
