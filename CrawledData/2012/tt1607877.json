            "Several, seemingly random, people from all walks of life board the Amsterdam city bus, all with different destinations. LINE 32 features a gripping and dynamic story about strangers who, through a series of events, are destined to be connected.At first glance, a sweaty, corpulent man, a Surinamese security contractor, a teenage schoolgirl, a famous television host, a Moroccan man in traditional clothes with his fifteen year old nephew, a young couple with a mysterious package and an elderly lady accompanied by a bum have nothing in common. Yet through a series of events, spanning six weeks, they all find their way on bus 32. When an anxious detective follows the bus, which is nearing the citys courthouse, with clamorous sirens, the bus falters. The police car crashes into the vehicle and a big explosion erupts. The blast shatters the windows of the courthouse where a controversial case, with an extreme right-wing politician and an assaulted woman of color, is held. The bus is consumed by fire and the court is in shambles. Going back six weeks LINE 32 follows the lives of everyone involved in the crash, witnessing the integral moments that lead to the event that would change them forever. The Moroccan man returns to the Netherlands to visit his family at a time his nephew is sick and tired of the injustice and prejudice he encounters everyday because of his background. The security contractor is accused of several break-ins while his irresponsible brother is doing drugs and wastes his life away. The teenage girls shaky relationship with her father, whos never home, drives her into the arms of a boy who plants a fake bomb in the City Hall. The same bomb that has the detective questioning his boss motives who proclaims the bomb was real. While the fear of terrorism is peaking, an elderly lady, who tries to make ends meet with a sick husband at home and bills that are stacking up, has an encounter with a bum who has found his own way to survive in the world. The young, free-spirited couple, who are balancing their relationship while building a future for themselves, set their sights on a famous painting which is owned by a suicidal man. The television host lets his job take over his life causing his marriage to fall apart and his make-up artist gets too closely involved with a politician who is forced to live in hiding due to his radical beliefs.Line 32 is a mosaic story about a diverse group of people who meet by coincidence but are bound by fate."
