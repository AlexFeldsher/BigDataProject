But after his club shuts down, KD has several choices but none that excite him. Until one night, when he happens to visit his friend Xerxes Mistry's 2 century-old house that's been lying dormant for years. He convinces Xerxes to give it on rent and puts his crazy plan into action - to turn this old building into the best all-night club/hangout the city's ever seen. He rounds up his wolf pack - Devang, a talkative gujju 'jugaad' specialist; Patrick, his trusty goofy British Mumbai-ite expat with a knack for designing spaces; and Maakad - his old friend who quite simply 'makes things happen'. Together with an extra-large, extra-crazy motley crew of friends, they kick off Bombay's first all-night party den - until things starts to get real.",

            "Set against the landscape of Bombay, KD (Kabir Dalal) a 28 year old entrepreneur has a head exploding with ideas. But after his club shuts down, KD has several choices but none that excite him. Until one night, when he happens to visit his friend Xerxes Mistry's 2 century-old house that's been lying dormant for years. He convinces Xerxes to give it on rent and puts his crazy plan into action - to turn this old building into the best all-night club/hangout the city's ever seen. He rounds up his wolf pack - Devang, a talkative gujju 'jugaad' specialist; Patrick, his trusty goofy British Mumbai-ite expat with a knack for designing spaces; and Maakad - his old friend who quite simply 'makes things happen'. Together with an extra-large, extra-crazy motley crew of friends, they kick off Bombay's first all-night party den - until things starts to get real.::Anonymous"
