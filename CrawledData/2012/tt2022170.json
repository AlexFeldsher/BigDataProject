            "Based on the Lifetime made-for-television moview set in suburban Texas, the Client List answers the question of how far a wife would go to save her family from foreclosure. The Texas starlet, (Jennifer Love Hewitt reprising her role in the original movie.), reprises her role as Samantha Horton the beleaguered housewife of an injured football star with three kids, a mortgage, and an eidetic memory. The former beauty queen now finds herself flat broke until she reads an advertisement for a massage salon and applies for the position only to find out that it is a front for a high end prostitution service. Initially repulsed, her dire circumstances lead her to accept. With her new position comes money, guilt and addiction. Her home life suffers as a result of her husband's lost pride and the long hours. Eventually the police step in to close the ring. Ostracized from her family and community, Samantha has one more card to play. Using her perfect memory against her former clients, she compiles a list of influential men in positions of power to help a local mayor win her campaign & her own freedom. "
