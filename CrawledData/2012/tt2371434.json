It is an extremely stressful and difficult job where a split-second's error in judgment can cause a catastrophic incident. Kaori had originally been a ground staff at the airport with an ambition to become an air traffic controller who directs the aircraft of all airlines, but an incident spurs her to resign and take the national exam. After completing rigorous training at the air navigation security college, she is assigned to Haneda Airport's Air Traffic Control Center as an air traffic controller just before she turns 30. When she gets up to the control tower with a mixture of nervousness, excitement and anxiety, the people she sees are a group of professionals who remain calm in the face of emergencies and protect human lives. Kaori guides aircraft with veteran air controller Takeuchi Hiromi for on-the-job training. Because of a little careless mistake that she makes, and incident occurs that is a step short of an accident. She gets discouraged, but no one scolds her for the mistake she made which makes her feel even worse. However, she listens to the feelings of Yuki Noboru and Kondo Yukihiro as air traffic controllers and gradually pulls herself together.",
