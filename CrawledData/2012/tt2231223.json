            "Flour is a comedy web-series about two sisters, Tulip (Deirdre McCullagh) and Violet (Jeni Miller), the modern day \"Odd Couple\". Tulip is carefree, impulsive, and doesn't know what she is doing with her life; and it doesn't bother her in the least. Violet, the older of the two sisters, is organized, driven, responsible, and level-headed. Tulip moved in with Violet and her boyfriend, Tristan (Michael Connolly), after her latest breakup, and is now turning Violet's day to day life upside-down, along with her crazy friends and their antics. Tulip's two best friends, Madison (Brianna Tillo) and Clay (Loren Lepre) also cause constant chaos in Violets otherwise stable and normal life."
