With new students Sheila and Tenn, Derek works to raise the club's social status, gain new members and create quality programming. When Xavier, a bored hacker with the key to running the online station and events, and the musically connected Callie join the radio team, it seems Emily's newspaper doesn't stand a chance. However, when the mob starts occupying the building across from the station, they become a bigger threat to the school and the radio station than Emily ever could. As tragedies strike the school in the form of student deaths, everyone is on a constant social lockdown, and its up to the media organizations to get the stories out and figure out what is going on, while keeping their lives.",
