            "Alec is a kid (the series begins when he's 11) who likes to play outside! It's a \"reality\" show based on a fish-out-of-water theme in which Alec finds himself in strange surroundings and must adapt & survive. The POV camera follows him through various adventures in diverse climates as he explains what tools and behaviors are necessary to get back to civilization. These have included seclusion on a beach, in mountains, desert, frozen tundra, and others. Alec has even traveled to Australia and other locations in the world to capture unique survival methods there.Earlier episodes have him using professionally made gear, but as the series progresses he grows more independent and creates more of his own tools from available resources. Realistic enough for kids, and a good message about getting away from TV and video games."
