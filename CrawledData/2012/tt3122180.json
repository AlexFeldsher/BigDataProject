Traveling in the show's signature mobile art gallery - a converted recreational vehicle, nicknamed the ArtV - host CJ Follini joins a different borough-specific guest host in each episode to meet a rising artist who's on the verge of breaking into New York City's competitive art scene. Each artist puts together an impromptu art show in the ArtV and invites residents from their neighborhood to view the work and share their opinions on camera about the art. One of the five artists will be selected to have their first ever solo gallery show, which will be featured in a future episode, courtesy of sponsor welcometocompany.com. Each episode also includes music from performers discovered through the MTA Arts for Transit \"Music under New York\" program.",
