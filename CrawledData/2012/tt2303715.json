            "Ten years ago they were on top of the world. Literally. A 2004 high school Science class hiking trip to Mt. Rainier led by Dr. A takes a group of teens miles away from their hometown of Roslyn, Washington. Senior Year brings mixed feelings of excitement and the fear of the unknown. Minds are on mother nature as well as on the beating of one's heart. Trekker, our jock and class president, and his teammates don't know how to stay with their girlfriends. Drama geeks Ramona and Isaac try to figure out if they'll be known in the real world. Sam and Madeline watch everything go down. Unknown to most on the trip, a discovery hidden by one changes each of the twelve. Once home, one of them disappears. It's 2014 when they are forced to reunite one by one to acknowledge what happened, to truly discover how they changed, to find out the world is coming to end and that they might be able to stop it.::Veer West Pictures"
