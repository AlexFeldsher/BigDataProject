This show uses the word Mafia to depict Amish teenagers whom charge for holding dances and must use two hands to try and brandish a shotgun.\nA wildly feeble attempt to look tough in this day and age of children like these playing with firearms and someone else getting hurt.\nOne minute watching this show is a minute you can never get back. It's so ridiculous you won't even laugh at it as you turn the channel."
