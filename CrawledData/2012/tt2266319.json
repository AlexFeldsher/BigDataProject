Being the youngest of seven brothers, David is tasked with being the household servant. He's been relegated beneath his brothers because they all have the honor of being brave warriors for King Saul. David grows up and becomes a good shepherd but still remains humble, sensitive and loving. Always accompanied by his harp, David composes beautiful Psalms and prayers to God. King Saul on the other hand, disobeys God's laws as well as God himself. Speaking through his prophet Samuel, God tells Saul that he will replace him with someone worthy, someone who will follow what is in his heart. Having said this, God withdraws his favor from King Saul and he becomes tormented by an evil spirit. King Saul starts health fails and he becomes depressed. Only David's music can soothe him. At this point, David splits his days between his family duties and the King. He is then anointed as God's chosen one to replace King Saul. One day, in camp, while bringing his brothers food, David hears the Kings decree that whoever manages to defeat the army of God's enemies shall have all the riches imaginable and his daughter's hand in marriage. Despite David's slim physique, he accepts the challenge and kills Goliath. From this moment on, by God's will and with the acclaim of the people, David becomes the new King of Israel. David weds Michal, which unchains a series of conflicts. By a series of events David is taken far from home and as if by destiny, he meets Abigail, whom he marries. He also keeps several lovers but his preferred wife is Bathsheba with whom he has a second son, after losing their first son, fruit of their forbidden love. David's life is marked by love and hate, intrigue, friendship, betrayal and forgiveness. David's legacy is to show mankind that all men are capable of committing sin and injustice, but that they'll only find the path when they obey God's laws."

            "The army of Israel is fighting to claim back Canaan, the land they forsook when they emigrated to Egypt during the seven year drought. The Israelites pray for a king and God gives then \"Saul\", promising never to forsake him as long as he follows his commands.In Bethlehem, the teenage \"David\" is out in the pastures looking after this father's flocks and singing songs to the Lord. But it seems that neither his father or his older brothers, all seasoned warriors in \"Saul's\" army, consider him of any value and they scoff at him and keep him doing menial tasks.\"Bathsheba's\" father,\" Illium\", who is a general in \"Saul's\" army, has a disagreement with the king and is ordered out of the army and the camp. As they travel, they are attacked by robbers and one rides off with \"Bathsheba\". \"David\" takes down the rider with his slingshot and she is rescued. \"Illium\" takes her and they continue on their journey home.\"Saul's\" army attacks the Amelakites as instructed but against the wishes of the Lord, he fails to destroy them all and all their livestock. He keeps the king for ransom and chooses the choicest animals for his soldiers. \"Saul\" is then aware that God has abandoned him for his disobedience and is desolate. He eventually becomes self-absorbed and loses all the wisdom God has given him. Only his son \"Jonathon\" is able to persuade him to see sense.To make matter worse, God sends the Prophet \"Samuel\" to castigate \"Saul\". But \"Samuel\" has also been given the command by God to locate the new king He has chosen to rule instead of \"Saul\" and reveals that this man is to be one of \"Jesse's\" sons."
