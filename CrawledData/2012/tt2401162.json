But certain people didn't want the prince to know the truth and tried to kill him. Instead of dying he and his 3 right-hand men were transported 300 years later. At the current Seoul (South Korea capital city) time there is this beautiful and hard working woman named Park Ha (Han Ji Min), who lost her memory when she was a kid and was sent to an orphanage, was adopted and went to America. When she went back to Korea to look for her family Park Ha and Lee Gak met when Lee Gak suddenly showed up in her rooftop house with his 3 men. Park Ha, who firstly thought that Lee Gak was an actor, has sent him away but the destiny kept uniting them more than once since Park Ha has been the reincarnation of Hong Bu yong, someone who the crown prince knew from the Joseon era. While enemies of Park Ha and Lee Gak were trying to hurt them in the present time, Lee Gak was thinking hard why was he sent to the future trying at the same time to adjust himself in the modern era."
