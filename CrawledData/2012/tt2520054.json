Young, ambitious, driven, straight shooting police officer ALICE KUNENE (27) is excited at the prospect of being transferred to this division, because it is her first post as Detective, but she has no real idea what Room 9 is and what cases she will be dealing with.

She immediately bumps heads with 57-year old Detective \"DARKNESS\" HARKNESS, the aging, grizzled, head of Room 9, because she is fundamentally a non-believer of all things supernatural. Alice is brought in, initially against her will, and indoctrinated in the ways of Room 9, which include working with key members of the unit, including research, 'Siri' using tech guru, RUBY PRINS (27), who despite being blind has preternatural powers of foresight, and Nigerian Voodoo man SOLOMON ONYEGU, an expert in all things paranormal.
