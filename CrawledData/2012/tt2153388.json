The Melbourne Olympics in 1956 was the big bang in the relationship between sport and Australian culture and identity. Legends were created left, right and centre. This was the classical age in Australian sport, characterised by pure natural talent, supreme physical fitness and mental toughness. Its apotheosis is Herb Elliott.
