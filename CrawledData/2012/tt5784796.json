But success stories are not too often heard. There are many Asian sons and daughters of the rich and powerful who are quietly doing well, either following in their parents' footsteps, and or making a life for themselves, on their own terms. This is an in-depth personality-driven series that shows what motivates this young generation of leaders (in their 20s, 30s and early 40s); what their lives are like; their family dynamics; and how their family name weighs down on, or bolsters them. The series aims to show how these heirs and scions of the most successful business and political families in Asia are quietly charting their own course, and raising the cachet. Through them, we also understand the inner workings of the business machinery, and cultural and political context that they work in.",
