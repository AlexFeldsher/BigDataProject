            "Ben Nicholson has an odd job. Sometimes he's a counselor, sometimes a public speaker. He goes to at least 40 funerals a year, visits hospitals every day, and faces scrutiny while in the public eye. He works weekends and holidays. And he's always underpaid.What happens when you get in a fight with your wife before you go to work - and your work is preaching at a church service? Leaving Eden finds out, giving you a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of Ben - pastor of a Midwestern church, his wife and family, and Lucas, the vicar - a pastor-in-training who is trying to balance grand ideas of theology with reality of the ministry. Shot in a multi-camera, hand-held style, and set to some of the best indie music anywhere, Leaving Eden follows Ben and Lucas as they encounter the trials, politics, pressure, joys and pains no one ever thinks of or considers of this odd job."
