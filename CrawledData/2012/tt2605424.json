But what happens when the people of Ridderdalen sooner or later finds out that Kevin is a fraud? Also, Kevin has to balance his new life with his old one, where he has to hide the truth from everyone; his family, including his curious little sister Mira; Eiril, his kindhearted new best friend; and Peder, his bully who will do anything to make Kevin's life as miserable as possible.
