He's got kinda a bipolar personality, and it'll take him less than a second to go from extremely nice to crazily mad for no reason. Lalo is a wealthy guy. He has anger problems. For this reason his doctor recommends him to keep busy and do something for others, help people somehow. That's why he decides to start a channel on Youtube to teach people how to be the perfect Latin lover. He's totally obsessed with a couple of things: women, the hate he feels towards his doctor and with his 2 sacred idols, Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. His opinions are extreme but he will really try to be more open minded about what's different. He'll take you from teaching you how to be the best friend ever to how to be a British Prince who parties too much with booze and girls and not get caught. From Gambia (Africa) to Paris, from Madrid to Los Angeles. You just can't miss Lalo.",
