Enlisting the assistance of a handsome lawyer who specializes in helping victims of such adoptions and a nerdy computer expert, she begins to learn more and more about what happened to her and others like her -- all victims of a network of doctors, nurses and nuns who stole newborns from their parents and sold them for adoption. She eventually meets her biological mother, an alcoholic from a small town in Southern Spain, and a sister she never knew she had. After she is mysteriously kidnapped, her loved ones eventually come to believe she has been murdered. In reality, she has been sold into sexual slavery in China.Ten years later, Maria manages to escape and return to Spain, where she finds that the lives of her adoptive and biological families have changed dramatically, as well as those of her lawyer and computer expert friends. She methodically sets about discovering exactly who was behind her kidnapping so that she can take revenge on the guilty."
