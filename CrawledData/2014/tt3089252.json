            "A story about an election day stuck in a time loop. A mid-level campaign operative, Jamie, keeps reliving her side's surprising 11th hour upset over and over. During one of her loops, something happens and she decides she's going to try and change the outcome. She'll be met with opposition from above in the form of the don't-rock-the-boat campaign manager, Richard, and below from jealous intern, Benjamin. She'll have to convince the other staffers that they're about to lose and that they'll all have to work together to break the cycle. As she keeps trying and failing to change her fate, Jamie realizes that she may be doomed to a life forever reliving the same, depressing day."
