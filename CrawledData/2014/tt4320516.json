With exclusive access to Britain's renowned Academy of Contemporary Music, this rockumentary follows students over the first term of the academic year as they follow their dream of making it big in the hard-to-break music business. First-year gospel singer Henrietta wants to be a chart-topping superstar, but struggles to shine in a class of talented vocalists. 19-year-old Ella is striving to develop her own musical style and stand out from the crowd. Trainee producer James has returned to college after being burnt by the music industry and, for hotly tipped college band Massmatiks, this year is all about getting their first record deal. With all the emotion, triumphs and disappointments, learning to rock is harder than it seems.",
