        "plot outline": "Big Money is an unscripted, un-staged, semi-reality/educational/informational program. It's filmed on location, in any city or any state, where we can teach our audience the fundamentals of making money in real estate. We named the show Big Money because the phrase encompasses what goes through most peoples head when they think about a real estate \"tycoon\". Making money in real estate is one of the classic American dreams. The crew at Big Money want to be instrumental in helping their viewers create their own American dream through an EMPIRE of real estate wealth. Doug Clark reviews different properties and teaches the audience the potential distressed properties actually hold. We've classified our TV program as semi-reality/educational/informational because we simply can't create 'reality TV', as it's known in the entertainment industry. To be frank, we're not interested in 'creating' reality TV (we don't have the time, budget, or the stomach!). We're here to show you the actual nuts and bolts of making money in real estate. We're not the most dramatic show on TV, but what you see is the REAL part of so-called 'reality TV'. Every week Doug Clark and the Big Money crew will teach and show examples of different ways to use real estate to make money, in a way the 'normal person' can understand. Big Money is filmed, in high-definition, edited, and produced with a small crew of media professionals that are the technical and production stuff, as well as, part of the cast.",
