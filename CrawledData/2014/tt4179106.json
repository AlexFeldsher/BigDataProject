        "synopsis": [
            "Rita is 4 years old, very determined and used to getting things her way. She has a very hungry friend, Crocodile, who lives in the bathtub. Most probably, Crocodile only exists in Rita's imagination, but in the films we see the world through Rita's eyes, and Rita believes in Crocodile. When Crocodile is around, Rita can go where ever she wants into the forest, on vacation, to the mountains or out fishing. Most often Rita and Crocodile are out exploring nature and being outside is a central part of the series. There are incredibly many things Rita wants to see and thinks she knows but less she actually manages to do. In her own humorous and naive way she learns about herself and about small and big things in the world around her without adult guidance. Crocodile helps Rita to find creative and funny solutions to her challenges without ever becoming didactic, and Rita always achieves her goal with Crocodile by her side. The friendship between Rita and Crocodile has both conflicts and feelings which small children will recognise.\nThe films are most basically about being 4 years of age and the guiding theme is the friendship between Rita and Crocodile."
