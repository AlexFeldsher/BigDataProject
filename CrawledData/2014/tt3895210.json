            "On the rocky riverbanks of coastal Maine, three teams of fishermen compete for an elusive but lucrative catch - baby glass eels. During the short season, the fishermen work round the clock to find prime fishing holes, protect profitable territory and haul in as many eels as possible, cashing in at approximately $2,000 a pound. It's imperative to keep each eel healthy for transport to Asia so it can be raised into a delicacy, and high demand means the fishermen could earn a six-figure salary in mere months. The competition is strong, the rivalry is intense, and the threat of danger is persistent as each team struggles to secure its slippery pot of gold."
