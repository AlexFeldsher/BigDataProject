It turns out that the deceased was smuggling weapons in conjunction with the local mafia and gangsters killed him on suspicion of undermining the warehouse with the goods. But in fact, the warehouse was blown up by the elusive fighter against evil Viking. Everybody thinks that he died many years ago, but he continues the fight against banditry with his own methods. Viking and Shevelkov attack mafia from two sides: the first acts his old methods, secretly, on-partisan, not relying on legal justice, and the second - a young idealist who follows the letter of the law. And while they are fighting separately, their efforts are in vain - the mafia network, supported by corrupt police and military sales, is too strong. But the time will come - our heroes will stand shoulder to shoulder and, having overcome all contradictions, will learn from each other and will crush their enemies. This is a spectacular exciting movie about truth and falsehood, good and evil, and most importantly - a real men.",
