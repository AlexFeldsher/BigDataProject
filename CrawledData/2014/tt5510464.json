            "\"Everyone is talking about the economy, but who can explain it? From that morning cup of coffee to your monthly mortgage payment, the economy affects every aspect of our lives, yet many Americans don't understand the basic drivers of our economic system. We're caught between bubbles and recessions, rising costs and dwindling paychecks, Main Street and Wall Street - a whirl of dollars and not much sense. With WE THE ECONOMY, award-winning directors and leading economic experts team up for a surprising and thought-provoking shortfilm series that tackles 20 essential questions about the U.S. economy. Told through animation, comedy, musical, nonfiction, and scripted films, WE THE ECONOMY seeks to demystify a complicated topic while empowering the public to take control of the nation's economic present - and their own economic futures.\""
