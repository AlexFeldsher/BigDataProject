Various \"matchmakers\" in the church nominate eligible dates, someone they think would be good and describe before the church why they picked the candidate. Then the guy says a few words and the church then narrows the field down to 3 finalists through ballot voting. The pastor picks a 4th candidate and the spotlighted single then spends time with all 4 doing a charity or other pre-selected activity. After that, the pastor selects a filtering game or interview process to observe the candidates and give insights into strengths and weaknesses, such that it's narrowed down to 3. Then, the single picks two finalists to date with the whole process and dates on camera. She evaluates with the audience pros and cons and what she's thinking and looking for, all the way along. Finally, she selects the winner to continue dating. It's a fun show giving many insights into relationships, thinking through the dating process with friendly voices feeding into it, for consideration.",

            "Each episode takes the Grammy award singer Natalie Grant to a church to match up one of their eligible singles. The church and pastor pick the guinea pig who then consents. Various \"matchmakers\" in the church nominate eligible dates, someone they think would be good and describe before the church why they picked the candidate. Then the guy says a few words and the church then narrows the field down to 3 finalists through ballot voting. The pastor picks a 4th candidate and the spotlighted single then spends time with all 4 doing a charity or other pre-selected activity. After that, the pastor selects a filtering game or interview process to observe the candidates and give insights into strengths and weaknesses, such that it's narrowed down to 3. Then, the single picks two finalists to date with the whole process and dates on camera. She evaluates with the audience pros and cons and what she's thinking and looking for, all the way along. Finally, she selects the winner to continue dating. It's a fun show giving many insights into relationships, thinking through the dating process with friendly voices feeding into it, for consideration.::lab rat"
