            "_Vasilisa_ (qv) is not a historical narrative but rather a reflection of the legend about passion and love that sprang to life amidst battles and cold Russian winter. In August 1812, a French military unit breaks into _Vasilisa_ (qv)'s village and accidentally kills her husband, the village mayor. _Vasilisa_ (qv), mad with grief, throws herself at the offenders. This is how she meets French officer Blier. The French retreat but Blier cannot forget the face of the Russian peasant woman. Having lost her loved ones, _Vasilisa_ (qv) assembles a partisan unit in woods. In one of the battles she saves Rokotov, a seriously wounded Russian officer, who falls deeply in love with her. _Vasilisa_ (qv) ends up torn between two men, two warriors in love with her: between Blier, a Frenchman captured by her unit, and Rokotov. What will be stronger, love or hatred? Forced to make this difficult choice, will she choose Rokotov or Blier? Who was that extraordinary Russian peasant woman, an enraged warrior or a woman in love?"
