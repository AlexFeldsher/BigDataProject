        "plot outline": "31-year-old Iwasaki Urara became a lawyer and did a disservice to client because of her own mistake in her first court case. This traumatised her and she gave up being a lawyer. Fretting that she isn't cut out to be a lawyer, Urara ekes out a living by working part time. She is saddled with a debt of 4 million yen in fees to become a lawyer and her days are empty without purpose in life or work. On the other hand, 41-year-old elite lawyer Ebisawa Rinka works for the largest law firm in the industry and is also rumored to be a candidate for a position at the top. She lives in a high-rise apartment, and likes fine wines and branded goods. Her philosophy is \"It's meaningless if I don't win\" and she often wins cases through high-handed methods. However, the methods that Rinka used in a case becomes evident and she is fired from the law firm. In addition, she is ousted from the bar association and no longer able to stand in a courtroom. She has no choice but to build up confidence in the many court cases she won so that she can win back credibility as a lawyer. Making Urara's acquaintance by chance, Rinka sets eyes on Urara's legal qualifications. She makes Urara do her bidding in an attempt to somehow regain her own qualifications.",

            "31-year-old Iwasaki Urara became a lawyer and did a disservice to client because of her own mistake in her first court case. This traumatised her and she gave up being a lawyer. Fretting that she isn't cut out to be a lawyer, Urara ekes out a living by working part time. She is saddled with a debt of 4 million yen in fees to become a lawyer and her days are empty without purpose in life or work. On the other hand, 41-year-old elite lawyer Ebisawa Rinka works for the largest law firm in the industry and is also rumored to be a candidate for a position at the top. She lives in a high-rise apartment, and likes fine wines and branded goods. Her philosophy is \"It's meaningless if I don't win\" and she often wins cases through high-handed methods. However, the methods that Rinka used in a case becomes evident and she is fired from the law firm. In addition, she is ousted from the bar association and no longer able to stand in a courtroom. She has no choice but to build up confidence in the many court cases she won so that she can win back credibility as a lawyer. Making Urara's acquaintance by chance, Rinka sets eyes on Urara's legal qualifications. She makes Urara do her bidding in an attempt to somehow regain her own qualifications.::https://mydramalist.com/11190-onna-wa-sore-o-yurusanai"
