To make matters worse, she falls hard and fast for Daniel, the school's swim team champion and Maddie's boyfriend. Over time Emma learns to control her powers and finds out that she is the Chosen One (the most powerful witch ever born). In addition, she discovers that the school's evil principal wants to steal the Chosen One's powers. Emma must stop her and keep her powers hidden from a skeptical Daniel, who hates magic. Everything comes to a head during the big school dance, when the Principal holds Daniel hostage and the two young witches must work together to defeat her.",
