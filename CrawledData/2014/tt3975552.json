            "Louie Tuminaro's dream was always to open the greatest gun shop in the west. So he sold everything and moved his family across the country, from the Big Apple to the small town of Hamilton, Montana, to make his dream a reality. Tune in to see what happens along the way as Tuminaro tries to balance business, family and small town living, and of course, make the sale."
