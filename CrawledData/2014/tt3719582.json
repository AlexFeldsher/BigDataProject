After Kelly's confession, her mother deserted her and her father without an explanation. Because of this, Kelly blames herself for her mothers' absence in her life. Now, Kelly has shut out just about everyone who cared about her in her life, except for her father, and her teenage cousin Michelle. Kelly is afraid of being hurt again by the people she loves and in turn stays emotionally disconnected from everyone. This year is different though. Kelly's father is getting serious with his new girlfriend Stacey, an all-star cheer-leading coach. When Kelly lashes out with contempt for her, Kelly's father makes her work for Stacey at her cheer gym, the last place she wants to be. Jason Walker is outgoing, likable and on the high school football team but knows football is not in his future. Jason's father, a controlling former college football star who was injured indefinitely on the first play of his professional career, now lives through Jason. He turned his love for the game into a dark obsession. Jason is compelled by his father to play football and his father will do just about anything to make sure Jason does what he says. Afraid of what lies ahead, Jason begins talking with his teammates who all seem to have a plan. He becomes jealous of the fact that they are in control of their own destiny, unlike himself. However, things are changing this year. After Jason pulls a prank on a guy that deserted the football team for cheer-leading, he becomes seduced by the sport of cheer-leading. Not only because of the attractive cheerleaders, but because it's something that can make him happy. Kelly and Jason are drawn to cheerleading, not because they have to, but because it's the only thing that can liberate them from their dark lives. Now, Kelly who is running from her past and Jason who is running from his future find themselves thrown into this unlikely sport. Even though it is obvious they are meant for each other, obstacles from their past begin to haunt them.",
