Most episodes begin with a brief comedy sketch and a commentary on the quality of the film and the book on their own merits. The adaptation analysis itself is divided into several parts, including 'What they didn't change', 'What they changed', 'What they left out all together' and occasionally 'What they added'. At the end of each episode The Dom presents his final thoughts on the adaptation.",

            "_Lost in Adaptation_ (qv) is a show where The Dom compares a movie adaptation to the book it's based on. Most episodes begin with a brief comedy sketch and a commentary on the quality of the film and the book on their own merits. The adaptation analysis itself is divided into several parts, including 'What they didn't change', 'What they changed', 'What they left out all together' and occasionally 'What they added'. At the end of each episode The Dom presents his final thoughts on the adaptation."
