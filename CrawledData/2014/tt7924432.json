        "plot outline": "\"Sex Buy Now\" is an exciting journey of the former erotic dancer Marta Szulawiak-Turska, who wants to find out how the sex business has changed since she herself was part of it. In the 2-episode documentary, Marta gets women and men to talk about how it feels to pay or be paid for sex. She tries to get answers to questions like: How sexual services have expanded in the Internet age? Who are the men and women who offer sexual services and scour escort agencies websites looking for thrills? What makes them choose this way of making a living? Not much is known about the Polish escort industry. Marta opens the door leading to a world that can only be seen through a peephole. Behind that door there are women and men who sell their bodies. The interviewees discuss their needs, preferences and the price they are willing to pay for pleasure and for pursuing their chosen way of making a living. After you watch this documentary, escort agency flyers will never be the same.",
