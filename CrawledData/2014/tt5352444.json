Move Over Cancer is Cancer Council's new campaign aimed at preventing cancer by encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle. To kick off the campaign, stars from the Waratahs, Cricket NSW, Swimming Australia, Central Coast Mariners and West Tigers competed alongside CEOs and office executives in BEAT THE PROS. The CEOs not only put their bodies and their egos up for a public bruising, but stumped up some serious cash too. Watch BEAT THE PROS on Fox Sports starting Monday 25 August to find out how the self-confessed number crunchers fared in crunching tackles from the West Tigers. Will the CEOs regret swapping deadlines for the Waratahs' backline?",
