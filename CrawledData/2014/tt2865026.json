Talfryn becomes infatuated with the lake visiting daily but doesn't see anything as magical as he did that day. What he doesn't realise is, he was also being watched from beneath the waters. The fairy princess of the lake falls in love with the farmer. Breaking her people's rules, she allows Talfryn to see her, he instantly falls in love but he doesn't understand why she wont tell him her name or even come out of the waters to talk to him. After a visit from his neighbor Mrs Williams, he reluctantly confides in her thinking she will laugh at him as did his fellow farmers, to his surprise Mrs Williams believes in the old folk tale and further more tells him secrets on how to catch the fairy maiden. Why and how does Mrs Williams know so much about the magical kingdom? Do Talfryn and the Fairy princess live happily ever after?",
