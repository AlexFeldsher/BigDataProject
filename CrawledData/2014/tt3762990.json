Each episode focuses on a different aspect of Jack's life: i.e. financial, romantic, family, environmental, creative, etc; each are in constant states of agitation. Jack, though enthusiastic, lacks the common touch to play 'the game,' that life sometimes necessitates. In refusing to comply with social niceties, he finds himself more often than not as an outsider looking in on life.",

            "_Yellow Brick Hell_ (qv) is where grand ambitions hits the harsh pavement of reality. Set in NYC, Jack's enormous expectations are the exact opposite of his current conditions. Jack struggles to make rent,, lives on an IKEA coach in a tiny one-bedroom apartment overlooking a polluted canal that he shares with an intensely paranoid 40-year-old roommate, all the while trying to find work as a comedian. Each episode focuses on a different aspect of Jack's life: i.e. financial, romantic, family, environmental, creative, etc; each are in constant states of agitation. Jack, though enthusiastic, lacks the common touch to play 'the game,' that life sometimes necessitates. In refusing to comply with social niceties, he finds himself more often than not as an outsider looking in on life.::Anonymous"
