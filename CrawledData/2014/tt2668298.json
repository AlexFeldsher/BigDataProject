            "The show uses such devices as flashbacks, flash-forward's and dream sequences to help tell the main story of each episode. Our main character, Steve's obsession with being a TV Show Host has driven him to the couch of a disinterested psychiatrist who is more interested in dissecting the contents of his sandwich than dissecting the contents of Steve's stories. Some of the events discussed during the session with the therapist is depicted in a flashback where we see Steve as a baby, played hilariously by Mr. DiGennaro in a diaper. We learn a key to the mystery that is Steve's psyche when we learn what his first words were!::anonymous"
