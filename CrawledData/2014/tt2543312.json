Their personal and professional partnership will be challenged by greed and ego while charting the changing culture in Texas' Silicon Prairie.::AMC",
            "The early 1980s was the early heyday of the technological revolution. Silicon Prairie, centered on Dallas, was one area in the US where much of the activity in this sector was happening. There were a few \"name\" corporate players in each sector, such as International Business Machines (IBM) in personal computers (PC), Xerox in document management, and Texas Instruments (TI) in semiconductors. Standard corporate practice was to improve technology gradually and charge customers a premium for successive technologically advanced models of products. Within this framework, there were many dreamers, often working in smaller companies or for themselves, who wanted their small, or not so small, piece of the pie, whether it be for fortune and/or fame, the latter often in having a lasting legacy. Those dreams also varied, from only doing things better than their competitors, however small, to producing things that were revolutionary for the time, that made the general public go \"wow\", as were the rationale for those dreams.::Huggo"
