Nazir leaves, but when he boards the bus home he finds he hasn't got the bus fare and, spotting Fahmida, begs her for the money. To stop the embarrassment of Nazir holding everyone up, she gives him the fare. When they find themselves sitting next to each other, bit by bit they begin a conversation that to their surprise shows they have more in common than they thought. Will Fahmida allow her prejudice against Nazir's poverty to get in the way of a potentially beautiful friendship? Or perhaps more?
