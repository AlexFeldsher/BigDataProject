            "The story follows Arima Kousei, a skilled pianist. However, he hasn't played since he played for his mother who died a few years ago. One day Arima meets a brilliant violinist at the park. After their meeting she tries to guide Arima back into the world of music.",
            "Piano prodigy Arima Kousei dominated the competition and all child musicians knew his name. But after his mother, who was also his instructor, passed away, he had a mental breakdown while performing at a recital that resulted in him no longer being able to hear the sound of his piano even though his hearing was perfectly fine. Even two years later, Kousei hasn't touched the piano and views the world in monotone, and without any flair or color. He was content at living out his life with his good friends Tsubaki and Watari until, one day, a girl changed everything. Miyazono Kaori is a pretty, free spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her personality. Kaori helps Kousei return to the music world and show that it should be free and mold breaking unlike the structured and rigid style Kousei was used to.::GAP 93",

After his mother, who was also his instructor, died, he had a mental breakdown while performing at a piano recital at the age of twelve. As a result, he is no longer able to hear the sound of his own piano playing. Two years later, Kosei still hasn't touched the piano and views the world in monochrome, without any flair or color. He has resigned himself to living out his life with his good friends, Tsubaki and Watari, until, one day, a girl changes everything. A fourteen-year old audacious, Kaori Miyazono is a free-spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her manic personality, helps Kosei return to the music world and shows that it should be free and mold breaking unlike the structured and rigid style Kosei was used to."
