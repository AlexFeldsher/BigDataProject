But once we start to decode the world in which this law is set, investigating everything from Greek statues to mortality rates, we gain a new understanding of the reality of human sexual relations three thousand years ago.

Yet that's just the beginning of a journey that will then shoot forward into outer space to explore the possibilities of prayer on other planets.
