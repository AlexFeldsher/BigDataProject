Her father, John, has been demoted to a retail 'floor' staff position at an electrical chain store, which has left him quietly nursing regret, shame and a series of mild heart attacks. Anna's bored ex-beauty queen mother, Noni, is dealing with the drop in her family's socio-economic status by slipping into a tasteful 'brut and benzo' fog. Upstairs, hyperventilating in a wardrobe, is Anna's anxiety-riddled 17-year-old brother, Michael. Hell, even the family dog looks like he could do with a stiff drink.",
