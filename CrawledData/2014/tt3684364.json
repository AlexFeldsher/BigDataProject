It has been two decades since the end of Apartheid and the dreams of 'Rainbow Nation' have begun to fade. The reality of leading a country out of dark times has proved a difficult task. Unemployment among the youth is high and crime, education, health care and housing shortages are big issues. However there is hope. Through 6 x 26-minute episodes +27: SOCIAL INNOVATORS OF SOUTH AFRICA tells the story of six social innovators - men and women who are crucial change-makers. They are passionate, community-centric activists who want to make a difference. Each episode focuses on one social entrepreneur and we get to know their personal history, what has motivated them, and the essence of how their project functions. We meet some of the individuals who help them and some of the people whose lives are being uplifted by their programs. With high production values, each episode of this documentary will also be shot by a different young director and crew. The way we make +27: SOCIAL INNOVATORS OF SOUTH AFRICA will therefore reflect the spirit and energy of the people we are documenting. Along with the 6 episodes there will also be a detailed behind-the-scenes series that will help to explain the landscape of the production and the upliftment ethos that underscores +27 as a whole.",
