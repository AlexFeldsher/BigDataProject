            "We've seen a lot of weird detectives recently. No matter where they worked: New York, New Orlean or New Hampshire. Weirdness is attractive thing in TV-thing. We are glued by this thing to the screens, expecting more non-ordinary (mis)behaviour which gives us delightment. Pure one, I dare say.This TV-series has given the feeling of content with absolutely non-standard attitude. DS Stone is like a small boy albeit wise one. His social solitude and loneliness give us a glimpse on the system with a foreign object inside. The system can work properly, nonetheless. I'd recommend this one to everyone who likes clever things with a juicy \"off-social\" protagonist."
