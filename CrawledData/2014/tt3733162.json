So, when a summer internship opportunity in New York arises, which may give her a head start with her ambitious plans, she is certain her parents will support her. Shockingly, they do not. And when they don't, Eve finds herself making decisions and choices that she believes are in her best interest. As she seeks to establish independence and her own sense of self-identity apart from her parents and twin sister, Eve soon learns, and at times, painfully, that her autonomous choices actually do affect others around her, and are, at times, more consequential than she ever imagined.",
