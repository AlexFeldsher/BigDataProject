            "The Center for Investigative Reporting (CIR) brings its signature journalism to public television this fall with Reveal, a four-part series presented by Oregon Public Broadcasting and being fed by NETA to PBS affiliates on October 1, 2014.Reveal is a first-of-its-kind television show that brings viewers deep into investigations and captures the drama and high stakes of the reporting process. Beginning with a lead documentary and closing with shorter, high-impact stories, each hour-long episode explores crucial and often underreported issues: from Her War, which explores why women veterans make up the fastest growing segment of the nations homeless population to State of Surveillance, a look at new technologies that are revolutionizing policing and giving officers access to more data than ever before.Hidden stories, uncovered; thats what Reveal is all about."
