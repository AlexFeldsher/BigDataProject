            "The endless wild chase of Roadrunner and the kinetic comic mayhem of Tom and Jerry meet catastrophic chaos physics with a mad scientist twist... It's one of the classic life-or-death struggles of all time - the devious spider in his never-ending pursuit of the crafty fly. Wordless stories and non-stop action tell the outrageous battles for supremacy and survival. But it's so much more than simple webs and wings, because this spider and this fly just happen to inhabit the super secret laboratory of a mad scientist bent on world domination. And with unlimited access to the equipment and gadgets and gizmos and devices, absolutely anything is possible...::Mark Byers"
