This is the world we're introduced to on Lowrider Brazil, as we're taken to Vida Real and see what it's like at Brazil's pioneering lowrider car club. The mastermind in charge of getting the club in full gear is Tatá, joined by his sidekicks Japonês and Alemão. Tatá is known for his no-nonsense approach towards newcomers. Japonês is a hot-headed auto mechanic. As for Alemão, he's a true chicano, and specializes in lowrider bike projects. The everyday challenges faced by these heroes and their ties with other lowrider aficionados are given special attention in a setting marked by a strict moral code, where everyone's devoted to a common passion: building lowrider cars and bikes.",
