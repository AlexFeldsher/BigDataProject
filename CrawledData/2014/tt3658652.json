Parking meters, no stopping zones, bus lanes, double parking, restricted hours, zone permits, alternate side parking, fire hydrants, loading areas...finding a place to park a car is practically impossible in today's urban jungle. This series captures the point of view of the hapless parking enforcers, tow truck drivers and those that give us the boot...the Denver boot. Because most viewers are usually only on one side of this scenario (receiving the ticket!). Street Jungle is an opportunity to see it from the other perspective. Dealing with the public is always a daunting task, but making a career out of being the bad guy takes a suit of armor. Street Jungle captures the vibe of the city, the frantic speed and the many moving parts that make a metropolitan city run. It is chaotic madness at its very best.",
