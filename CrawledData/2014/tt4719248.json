But is the life of our characters as perfect, as it seems to be? Anger and misunderstanding have accumulated between Alena and Oleg. Alena spends all her time on caring of her child and became estranged from her husband. Oleg is busy developing his business and does not feel comfortable at home. One day a representative of the foreign partners arrive to Moscow. Briggita is beautiful, full of energy and ready for adventures, and she falls in love with Oleg. Alena tries to return her active life back, but there are a lot of intrigues and danger on her way. Vadim feels that his golden days on stage are over; he is going through a professional crisis.

In the circle of all these life crises Alena finds out that Vadim happens to be a biological father of her baby. How these news will affect our heroes? Will it be the chance to start a new life or a reason to destroy everything they have now? Who will be support, and who - a traitor? Who will be chosen by Alena? Who will become a real father to his son? Will our heroes find love again? And which of them will be able to understand, to forgive and to love?",
