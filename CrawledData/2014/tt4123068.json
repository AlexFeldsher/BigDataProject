He died an extraordinary man of his times: renowned novelist, poet, ophthalmologist, journalist, and linguist. But behind these achievements, there remained the story of a man every Filipino can relate and connect to. Like today's overseas Filipino, Rizal needed to leave his family to fulfill his studies and career abroad, suffering from homesickness, and enduring a long-distance relationship with the woman he loved most. He was also the best example of the Filipino who came back home and used the knowledge and skills he learned abroad to help improve the lives of his family and countrymen.",
