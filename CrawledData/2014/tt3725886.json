            "The Therapist (if she even is a licensed psychologist) has decided that college students should have access to affordable and quick therapy. The college counseling center offers great services, but is so busy that if students want to make an appointment they have to make it a month in advance. Its really hard to predict when youre going to have a break down, and its even harder to realize that you need help. Thats why The Therapist has set up a booth around campus. On the spot, students can get some counseling from this mysterious two dollar therapist.From the creative mind of Yasmin Ghasiri comes a Company 7 series that looks at what the generation of millennials actually has to go through. An extremely relatable series, Two-Dollar Therapy is a must see for people of all ages."
