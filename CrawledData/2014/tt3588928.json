            "Where dark comedy meets insanity so commonplace, monsters uphold the law!An irreverent & noisy parody group sketch comedy set in the dysfunctional town of Down Town, this show follows the bizarre events & disturbing antics of its' inept residents. We meet Harry Pothead, an unemployed junkie \"wizard\". There's also a priest who's got anger management problems & God on speed dial & the Karma Police, cops who uphold the law by breaking it themselves. The action takes place in & around the town's many location points including the Down Town Hotel, where no member of staff is wihout their quirks. And, just to top it all off, they hold the town's weekly addictions anonymous meetings here, but don't expect alcohol to be one of them...\n"
