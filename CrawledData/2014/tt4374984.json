            "Jimba is a turquoise creature living on an undiscovered island, called \"Isla Kunza\", somewhere in the middle of the ocean.\nAs curious and infantile as he is, he plays with any object, he finds on Isla Kunza.\nAfter some time a civilization, ruled by the radically religious dictator \"Arkunzad\" has formed on the island. Jimba and his friends Ria and Omsku see themselves as destined to plan a revolution, depose Arkunzad and free the citizens. Sadly, most of the island's population accepts or ignores being suppressed by Arkunzad. As if things couldn't get worse, there already exists another revolutionary underground association, which is trying to achieve the same goals and tends to be more successfull, due to their professionality."
