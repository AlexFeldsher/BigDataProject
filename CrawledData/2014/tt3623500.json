Our contestants are inspired by good old home cooking, a love of entertaining and the belief that they can provide both those things anywhere in the world! The Cast: Consists of 8 teams who represent the diversity of New Zealand. Each team will be composed of two people who might be dating, married, or divorced; they could be siblings; mother and son, father and daughter; lifelong friends; flatmates or co-workers. Their combined cooking and hosting abilities, and the dynamics of their relationship under the stress of competition, is a focus of the show. The Twist: From the start of the series, the big surprise of where our teams will end up is alluded to - they always know that something is going to happen - they just don't know when or where the big twist will happen - they only know they need to be ready to cook dinner and serve it, anywhere in the world. How it works: Stage 1: Home Hosting Our teams prove they can cook and entertain in their own homes for their fellow contestants and our expert judges. Stage 2: Around New Zealand Our teams prove they can cook and entertain anywhere in New Zealand, under any circumstances, in any weather, after completing a series of fast-paced challenges set by our judges. Stage 3: Overseas Our teams are taken to an exotic mystery destination, where they will have to work even harder to prove their ability to cook and entertain in unfamiliar surroundings. Stage 4: The Finals Back in New Zealand our teams battle face off in the final battle for hosting supremacy, culminating in a live elimination.",
