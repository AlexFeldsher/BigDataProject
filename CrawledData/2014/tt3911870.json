            "The series begins with a short-lived love triangle between Pragya - Suresh Srivastav - Bulbul, leading to the cancellation of Pragya and Suresh engagement. In parallel, Abhishek is in a relationship with the supermodel, Tanushree (Madhurima Tuli / Leena Jumani). Purab Khanna (Arijit Taneja / Vin Rana), is Abhishek's best friend and engaged to his sister, Aliya (Shikha Singh). However, Purab and Bulbul fall in love but in a bitter twist of fate, Aliya, Tanushree, and Abhishek feels that Purab loves Pragya. The trio plans revenge and arranges for Pragya to marry Abhishek.\nPost-marriage, Pragya realizes the truth and accepts the blame to protect Bulbul. On the day the marriage is fixed for Purab and Aliya, Purab abandons Aliya and marries Bulbul. Various situations and circumstances bring Abhishek and Pragya closer. Realising the wrongdoings of Aliya and Tanushree, Abhishek reconciles with Purab and Bulbul. Desperate to get Abhishek back, Tanushree fakes a DNA report to imply that he is the father of her unborn child, which is actually the result of a one-night stand between her and Nikhil. Pragya realises the truth but suffers an accident and is declared dead, before she could reveal the truth to Abhishek.\nThe story takes a 2-month leap and Pragya returns to exact revenge on her wrongdoers. In the meantime, jealousy and hatred begins to grow in the relationship of Bulbul, Purab, and Aliya. Bulbul risks her life and dies while saving Pragya from Aliya. The season ends with Pragya exposing Tanushree and winning back Abhishek's trust. They propose each other. However, Abhishek gets into an accident and loses his memory. He forgets the last two-and-a-half years of his life, including Pragya. She leaves Abhishek for his protection but does not divorce him.\nTo save Kumkum Bhagya Marriage Hall, Pragya begins to work as a receptionist at the Love Life Music Company, where she meets Abhishek again and begins to form a deep friendship. Taking advantage of his memory loss, Aliya schemes to get Tanushree married to Abhishek. Pragya and Abhishek fall in love but he is compelled to marry Tanushree as her mother's last wish to see her daughter happy. Nikhil kidnaps Pragya on the day of Abhishek's wedding and he leaves the rituals to save her. Abhishek regains his memory, marries Pragya again, but loses her soon after when goons hired by Nikhil shoots her, and she falls into the dam.\nA couple of weeks pass, Abhishek is still searching for Pragya, and comes across a villager named Munni, who is Pragya's lookalike. Abhishek takes Munni home to save her from terrorist attacks. Aliya blackmails Munni into helping them. Pragya returns to Mumbai after being in coma, meets Munni, and swaps places to enter the Mehra household. In the meantime, Purab meets Disha (Ruchi Savarn). After Disha confesses her love, Purab feels guilty about still loving Bulbul and decides to give her the love she deserves and they consummate their marriage. Pragya saves Abhishek's life multiple times from a mysterious woman who turns out to be Simonika (Vivana Singh), his secretary. She wants revenge from Abhishek for killing Dushyant, her husband. Her plans go awry and she is arrested. She escapes police and reaches Mehra house. Tanushree deals with Simonika to spare Abhishek's life and kill Pragya instead.\nIn a major showdown and season closure, Dadi succumbs to bullet injuries suffered at the hands of Simonika, while Pragya was on her way with police to the factory where Simonika was supposed to be hiding. Dadi feared for Pragya's safety and reached the factory beforehand to confront Simonika. Both Aliya and Abhishek holds Pragya responsible for the family's misfortunes and banishes her from their lives. A devastated and grief-stricken Pragya is shown attempting suicide by jumping from the top of a cliff.\nThe Mehra family now reside in New Delhi, but the entire dynamics of the family has changed. Abhi is married to Tanu, Aliya manages Abhi's career and business assets, and Purab and Disha have a son named Sunny. Dasi has taken the post of head of the family after Dadi's death. Despite them being married to one another, Abhi and Tanu share no husband-wife relationship whatsoever and even sleep in separate bedrooms. Aliya and Tanu's friendship for whatever reason mysteriously ended, with the former not accepting the later as her sister-in-law. Abhi turned his musical career into more of a business and Tanu is preparing for a comeback in her modeling career by entering an upcoming Mrs. India beauty pageant. Although the rest of the family (except Aliya and Tanu) miss Pragya dearly, Abhi still bitterly hates her for Dadi's death while struggling to suppress his love towards her.\n7 Years Later\nMeanwhile, Pragya survived her suicide attempt and now resides in the U.K. She is the manager of King Singh, a London-based rapper and has a daughter named Kiara. Although Abhi is Kiara's biological father, King has named himself Kiara's legal father and loves her as if she is his own, and Abhi has no idea Pragya has given birth to his daughter. The three of them live together in the same house, but King and Pragya are not married and she only claims to be so in order to get King out of bad situations (like getting thrown in jail). It is unknown when King and Pragya met and under what circumstances, but they both show a mutual friendship towards one another.\nWhile Pragya has taken Abhi's words to heart and still feels responsible for Dadi's death, King constantly tells her to let go of the \"Mumbai-wala\" guy and the injustices she suffered through because of him.\nAbhi in Delhi and King in London both receive a contract to work on a world music album from a Delhi-based organizer. Believing she is the reason for his success, King asks Pragya to accompany him to Delhi and bring Kiara with her. Although hesitant at first, Pragya agrees thinking that she will not run into Abhi, completely oblivious to the fact that the Mehra family now lives in Delhi. On the flip side, Abhi's Swarni Dadi informs the Mehra family that she is going to be staying with them for a while and asks Abhi to come pick her up from the airport, coincidentally on the same day King, Pragya, and Kiara land in Delhi. At the airport, Abhi and Pragya feel each other's presence for the first time in seven years but do not come face-to-face. Abhi also has his first run-in with Kiara and feels an instant connection to her due to her personality resembling Pragya's, and Kiara on the other hand thinks Abhi is very arrogant and full of himself.\nAfter learning that Swarni Dadi missed her flight, Abhi heads home but a misunderstanding with cars leads Kiara to leave one of her dolls in Abhi's car and he accidentally takes it home with him. Because of this, Kiara nicknames Abhi the \"doll chor.\"\nAfter checking into their hotel, King and Pragya decide to get Kiara enrolled in an international school, which coincidentally ends up being the same school that Sunny attends. The same day Pragya brings Kiara to get her admitted, Abhi is visiting to help a friend enroll her children in the current term. They again feel each other's presence but do not come face-to-face. Kiara is initially denied enrollment for the current term because it is too late, however, a mix up with recommendations allows Kiara to gain admission along with Abhi's friend's children. King and Pragya are both confused as to who could have helped them with admission, and Abhi has no idea that he indirectly helped Kiara's admission. Sunny and Kiara also meet at the school and develop a rivalry towards one another after Kiara throws water on Sunny's uniform.\nAbhi and King run into each other twice on separate occasions due to Abhi nearly running his car into King's. Their egos clash and they get into heated arguments with one another, but King walks away from them. They are both unaware of each other's stardom and mutual connection (the connection being Pragya) towards one another. Swarni Dadi also arrives at the Mehra mansion with no idea that Abhi and Pragya's marriage ended seven years prior and that Tanu is Abhi's wife, and no one has the heart to tell her what happened.\nKing and Pragya are visited by King's distant Chachi and cousin Tarun just as a press conference is organized for Abhi and King to meet one another and announce the album. Pragya is unable to accompany King to the press conference because she has to drop off Kiara to her first day of school, so she suggests King take Tarun instead under his wing so he can earn some work experience and she will meet them at the conference later. Abhi, on the other hand, takes Swarni Dadi and Mitali with him to the conference.\nAs Abhi and King prepare to make their entrance, Kiara is placed into Sunny's class, and Pragya and Disha narrowly miss each other after dropping off their kids for school. After finding out King is being paid more than Abhi for the album, Aliya pays some of Abhi's fans to cheer more for Abhi so the album organizers are coaxed to putting Abhi on the cover only and omitting King completely. Tarun overhears and conveys this information to King who becomes determined to expose Abhi's camp resorting to \"cheap business tactics\" in order to get their way.\nDuring the conference, Abhi and King come face-to-face and get into a heated argument about who is better than the other. Frustrated and annoyed with Abhi's ego, King, with the help of Tarun, exposes the fans who were paid to help Abhi's stardom, resulting in a fight breaking out between Abhi's fans and King's fans.\nAbhi initially denies being responsible but realizes later only Aliya could pull this trick off. He finds out from Purab that Aliya was behind the mishap and demands she cancel his contract so he will not have to work with King. Pragya arrives at the conference while all hell has broken loose and runs into Swarni Dadi.\nBefore Swarni Dadi can say anything, an emotional and confused Pragya abruptly leaves from there and runs into an angry King outside the hall. King apologizes to Pragya for his behavior and accuses Abhi of being a businessman rather than a proper musician. He asks Pragya to cancel his contract, but later she convinces him to reconsider after reminding King that by canceling the contract he is not giving up his dream but also Pragya and Kiara's dream. King agrees to do the album under the condition that Pragya does not get involved with his feud with Abhi. Despite all this happening, Pragya has no idea that Abhi is the singer King is referring to.\nSwarni Dadi and Mitali inform Abhi and the rest of the family that they saw Pragya at the press conference. After a fight with Tanu, Abhi tells Swarni Dadi that his marriage with Pragya ended seven years ago because she broke his trust (but leaves out the fact that he blamed Pragya for Dadi's death). This leads to a drunk Abhi leaving to go back to the conference hall and inquire about Pragya, but only after Swarni Dadi asked him to do so. However, he gets into a minor accident with King's car.\nAfter an argument, they are both arrested for drunk driving. Pragya is informed by Tarun of this and goes there to bail out King. Tanu is notified of this from a police officer and she, along with Purab, go to bail out Abhi.\nWhile Pragya is trying to convince the inspector there to let King go, Abhi sees her for the first time in seven years. Before he can approach her, Abhi overhears Pragya mentioning that she and King have been married for the past seven years and backs off, but does not realize that the person she is referring to is King. Purab convinces another inspector to let Abhi go but on the way home, Abhi abruptly stops the car to run back to the police station and demand an explanation from Pragya, but he arrives just as she is leaving herself.\nOnce he arrives home, Abhi again blames Pragya for not coming back home to mend their marriage and decides he will not pursue her again. On the other hand, Pragya asks King to change his angry behavior if not for her and Kiara, but for himself and his career; and King is confused and frustrated at Abhi's insecure, possessive, and oppressive behavior.\nWhile waiting for a meeting to start at the same hotel King, Pragya, and Kiara are staying at, Abhi runs into Kiara again and they end up getting stuck in a dark elevator together. While Pragya scatters to get the elevator working, Abhi and Kiara bond after she calms down Abhi, who is afraid of the dark, and after she shows off her intelligence by unlocking his smartphone without him telling her his password.\nPragya manages to fix the elevator and reunite with Kiara just as Abhi leaves. Tanu also sees Pragya for the first time in seven years after meeting a friend there, but she distracts Abhi so that he does not come face-to-face with Pragya. When Abhi attends his meeting for a potential ad deal, he finds out that King has also been offered the same deal. King calls out Abhi for being more concerned about his image than his passion and accuses him of being a fraud.This nearly leads to a fist-fight, but Abhi walks out of the deal and blames Aliya for not checking who he was paired with. King also walks out of the deal declaring he has no desire to work with Abhi, and then asks him to stick to his word.\nMr. Wick, the organizer of the worldwide music album, eventually calls Abhi and King back for another meeting at his label. He urges Abhi and King to treat this deal as a \"business marriage\" by putting their egos and differences aside and collaborate on the album, and by doing so they will gain more popularity and fans.\nWhile King says he will think about it, Abhi receives a phone call from Sunny's school and abruptly leaves without telling anyone the reason. Upon reaching the principal's office, Abhi finds out that the girl who was bullying Sunny is none other than Kiara. After hearing Abhi call her a bully and troublemaker, Kiara manages to convince the principal that she does not bully Sunny and that Sunny bullies her on Abhi's saying.\nAfterward, Kiara is upset with Abhi and asks him not to speak to her again. Abhi leaves the school upset about this but does not know why he feels this way.\nAfter terrorists break in Sunny and Kiara's school and take everyone hostage, Abhi rushes back to save Sunny and manages to sneak in through the back. Pragya also finds out about the attack on the news and sneaks in herself to save Kiara.\nAs Abhi and Pragya separately try to save everyone inside and narrowly missing each other, King finds out late about the attack and ditches his meeting to rush to the school. When Sunny and Kiara plan a break-out attempt, they are separated and taken the hostage in different rooms. Pragya manages to save Sunny after he tries to get away, oblivious to the fact that he is Purab and Disha's son. At the same time, Abhi manages to free Kiara and the rest of the students and staff while he stays behind to fight off the terrorists.\nPragya and Sunny are reunited with Kiara and the rest of the staff and students in the hallway just as the police show up. Kiara asks Pragya to save the \"doll chor\" fighting the terrorists, and she reluctantly agrees. Soon there is a stand-off with the police and terrorists, who are holding Abhi at gunpoint. Pragya sees this from a window but does not see Abhi's face clearly. She manages to throw a paperweight at one of the terrorists just as he shoots his gun, but the bullet hits the window Pragya is standing next to and she ducks down.\nAfter the police capture the terrorists, Abhi thinks that Pragya saved him but when he goes to check there is no one there, as she herself is escorted outside. While Abhi concludes that it was just his imagination, King arrives outside the school just as the situation is sorted and reunites with Kiara.\nAbhi and King eventually decide to put their egos aside and collaborate on the worldwide music album. After signing their contracts, they both decide to challenge each other to prove who is better than the other through this album. King convinces Mr. Wick to let him organize the album announcement party at his newly purchased house, and also asks Abhi to invite his wife.\nAbhi agrees, on the condition that King also bring his wife so they can both meet each other and see whose wife is better. While Abhi tells Tanu to come to the party on time, King shares with Pragya the news that he decided to work on the album and about their challenge. King also asks Pragya to pose as his wife for the party because of the condition Abhi put forth, Pragya is initially annoyed but agrees so she can help King win the challenge. Abhi ends up attending the party alone after finding out Tanu is out drinking with her friends. Tanu initially decides to attend the party for Abhi's sake but realizes she's had too much to drink and heads home instead.\nAfter discussing the terrorist attack at their school, Sunny and Kiara apologize to each other for their behavior and become friends. On the night of the party, Pragya sends Kiara to Sunny's house with their driver so they can work on a class project together, completely unaware about the relationship between Kiara and Sunny's family. Kiara bonds with all of the Mehra family except Tanu, who finds her rude and annoying.\nAt the party, King and Pragya are enjoying the party with each other while Abhi hangs out by himself. When King and Abhi are called on-stage to launch the album, King asks his wife to come on-stage and through this, Abhi and Pragya come face-to-face with each other.\nBoth are initially shocked and emotional upon seeing each other, but Abhi ends up storming off stage in anger and starts drinking at the bar. On the other hand, Pragya is unable to control her emotions because she is still deeply hurt by Abhi blaming her for Dadi's death. While Abhi decides to question her about her decision to remarry, Pragya decides to tell him the truth about her relationship towards King thinking that destiny wants her to reunite with Abhi.\nHowever, after the two share a dance (with King's permission), Pragya walks off upset after Abhi hurts her with his grip. Pragya realizes that their marriage is broken beyond repair and that it is too late for Abhi to ask for forgiveness, and even if destiny wants them to save their marriage Abhi's hatred will always triumph over Pragya's love. She concludes that instead of causing each other more pain by bringing up bad memories, it's better to just forget about what happened and move on and cherish the happy memories instead. Meanwhile, King sensed that Pragya was feeling uncomfortable during her dance with Abhi and asks her to stay away from Abhi.\nEventually, Abhi and Pragya end up alone together in a guest room after Abhi injures his hand and Pragya bandages his wound out of good will. Before Pragya can leave, they get into a massive fight. Abhi furiously accuses Pragya of cheating him by marrying King instead of coming back to save their marriage after what he claims to be a small fight that she took seriously. He also accuses Pragya of breaking all the promises she made to him and going back on her word. Pragya realizes Abhi hasn't changed at all, he still holds her responsible for his mistakes and will continue to blame her. Pragya calls him out for questioning her decisions when he himself threw her out his life, married someone else, and for not truly understanding the kind of person she is.\nWhen Abhi does not accept his mistake and insults King instead, Pragya is clearly offended and demands Abhi does not talk about King that way because he (King) stood by her and understood her feelings and situation when Abhi wasn't there, because of this Pragya holds a great deal of respect towards King. Abhi is unable to bear this reality but before he can say anything else, Pragya walks away from the fight upset.\nAbhi, drunk, goes home. Kiara, who is there to work on a project with Sunny, Purab and Disha's son, wins the heart of all Mehra family members. While leaving, Kiara sees an upset Abhi and tries to bring his spirits up. Kiara is able to bring up his spirits slightly but also learns that Abhi had a wife prior to Tanu, whom she does not like. Abhi thinks that if he were to have a daughter, she would be just like Kiara. The next day, Abhi decides to quit the album due to Pragya's involvement, but this would cause Abhi to have to be on a 3-year music probation as well as pay King the same amount of money he was to get. Pragya knowing this, and not wanting Abhi to incur any losses, goes to Abhi's house and plays a trick on him by thanking him for backing out of the album and realizing that King is much better than him. To prove himself, Abhi challenges Pragya that he will do much better than King.\nA few days later, while going to the bank for some business, Abhi and Pragya see each other. They get into a small argument once again, but in the meantime, some robbers come into the bank and hold the people inside as hostage. King and Tanu hear the news of the bank robbery and get really worried. Inside, Abhi and Pragya work together to get the robbers caught to the police and help a little. The police come in and shoot at all the robbers and arrest them. In the ensuing battle, Abhi gets small injuries. A worried King and Kiara come to Pragya's aid and do not let her out of their sights, even though she wishes to say thank you to Abhi. Kiara learns that it was Abhi only who saved her mother during the robbery. Kiara tells Pragya that Sunny's \"chucks\" had saved her, but assumes he is one of the police officers.\nWhen Abhi goes home, he goes into a coma and is rushed to the hospital. Tanu and Aliya try very hard to get him back but to no avail. Pragya hears of Abhi's accident through King and tries to meet him. She calls Aliya to ask about his health, but Aliya only yells at her saying she took her Dadi away from her and now she will take her brother. Pragya decides to meet him secretly. When she gets to the hospital, she dresses as a nurse and puts on a mask. She goes to Abhi's room and tries to get him to wake up. Abhi wakes up after Pragya leaves. Aliya and Tanu believe they are the reason behind Abhi's improving health. Abhi gets sad that Pragya did not come to visit him in the hospital and only sent King. He is soon sent home.\nAt the Mehra household, Aliya is fumed seeing the closeness between Purab and Disha. She gets fed up and asks Purab and Disha to leave the house and insults Disha. Purab decides he has had enough of Aliya and tries to leave Mehra Mansion. Abhi sees this and says he will leave with Purab and Disha. Seeing his act, the rest of the family also says they will leave with Purab and Disha. Aliya, seeing that everyone is willing to leave her easily, apologizes to Purab and Disha and asks them to stay back.\nKiara decides to visit Abhi and goes to his house. When she is about to see Abhi, he is talking to a picture of Pragya. Kiara asks Abhi to show the picture, to see if Tanu is prettier, or the girlfriend. Abhi says no, so she decides to spend time with Sunny. When about to go downstairs, Tanu decides to pour oil on the stairs to make Kiara fall and teach her a lesson. She sends Sunny to get some book, while Kiara falls down the stairs. Tanu immediately cleans up the oil, to remove all evidence. Kiara starts to cry and Abhi runs to her aid. Kiara, in the meantime, calls Pragya to come to Sunny's house. Abhi kisses and hugs Kiara and takes her to his guitar room. He effectively diverts Kiara's attention from her pain to the cool instruments.\nKiara was worried because if her mom comes here she'll scold Abhi for not taking care of her daughter well. Abhi says he'll handle her, but Kiara says, \"no, I don't want you in trouble because I love you so much and I wanna come to this home again and again. If my mom came here, she will not let me come here\".\nSo before Pragya reaches there Disha decided to drop Kiara in the home and takes her to the home on the way Kiara calls Pragya and tells her to return home. Pragya scolds Kiara for not doing everything as her wish. On the way, her car gets repaired in front of Abhi's home. Abhi helps her to repair the car. They look at each other and smile as still, they care for each other. Abhi gets upset after she left. He started to feel Pragya and Kiara all related in some way because Kiara behaves as a Shadow of Pragya. And in Kiara's home, Disha learns Pragya is Kiara's mom and rushes home to inform Abhi. In the meantime, Abhi tells Purab that Pragya is married to the king. Purab consoles him and leaves. Then Disha meets Purab and says Kiara is Pragya and Abhi's daughter. But Purab cannot accept it as he says she will be King's daughter. Disha denies by saying Kiara behaves like Abhi so definitely she'll be Abhi's daughter. Purab assures her well find that soon then we will inform Abhi. Someday Purab, Disha, Tanu, and Abhi goes for jewelry shopping for Purab and Disha's anniversary. Pragya was there to purchase a chain for her daughter. By fate, a mangalsutra from Abhi's hands lands on Pragya's neck. Both get emotional. Tanu sees this and taunts Pragya. Purab Disha meets Pragya after 7 years and gets emotional. King too arrives there. Tanu invites King & Pragya to Purab Disha's anniversary party. Abhi and Pragya are heartbroken seeing each other with their namesake partners."
