            "Sami (Elona Finlay) and Duder (Chris Allen) are brother and sister with their own band \"Reeces Peices.\" Every year they compete in their school's Battle of the Bands competition and every year they lose. But not this year. In order to have a better chance in the competition, the pair decide to have auditions. However, no one shows up. No one except awkward and shy guy Kevin (Nick Lang). In a fit of nerves, Kevin runs from the garage where the auditions are being held and is unfortunately struck down by a car and left in a coma. Sami and Duder then find themselves using Kevin's music and calling it their own. They gain local fame and are living the dream. But what will happen if their 'Little White Lie' is found out?"
