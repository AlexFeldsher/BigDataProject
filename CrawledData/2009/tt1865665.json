Lasse, the star of the show, is a very curious and cheeky eleven year old boy from Hamburg. In each episode he invites a famous German chef. The chef helps him to prepare various delicious meals or together they come up with exciting new ones. Lasse and the chef go on a journey to discover the world of cooking. In each episode Lasse visits different locations, meets new people. Thus, he learns all about the origins of the ingredients and how they are processed. Most of the cooking takes place in the kitchen of an old Hamburg boat house. The passing of ships and the noises from the harbor create an atmosphere of adventure and excitement. While Lasse and the chef wait for the dishes to finish in the oven they take delight in all kinds of creative activities. Cartoon Network Topfrocker - Lasse tischt auf is more than just cooking.",
