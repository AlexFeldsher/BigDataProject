Picking up where Run's House left off, Daddy's Girls follows the exploits of Vanessa and Angela Simmons navigating their way through the fast lane of Hollywood, all while applying the valuable moral lessons their Daddy instilled in them. As Rev's girls acclimate to their new city, Vanessa and Angela take the critical steps in setting up a permanent residence in Los Angeles, including setting up west coast operations of their Pastry shoe line. Although Vanessa and Angela enjoy an exciting socialite lifestyle, they still face the same issues and challenges as other young women their age. Between dating problems, friend dynamics, and catfights, there is never a dull moment in their lives. The Rev knows his daughters are growing up and he has to let them mature in to young independent women, but to the Rev, they will always be Daddy's Girls.",

            "We watched Rev Run's daughters grow up on MTV's Run's House. Now watch them come of age in _Daddy's Girls_ (qv). Picking up where Run's House left off, _Daddy's Girls_ (qv) follows the exploits of Vanessa and Angela Simmons navigating their way through the fast lane of Hollywood, all while applying the valuable moral lessons their Daddy instilled in them. As Rev's girls acclimate to their new city, Vanessa and Angela take the critical steps in setting up a permanent residence in Los Angeles, including setting up west coast operations of their Pastry shoe line. Although Vanessa and Angela enjoy an exciting socialite lifestyle, they still face the same issues and challenges as other young women their age. Between dating problems, friend dynamics, and catfights, there is never a dull moment in their lives. The Rev knows his daughters are growing up and he has to let them mature in to young independent women, but to the Rev, they will always be _Daddy's Girls_ (qv)."
