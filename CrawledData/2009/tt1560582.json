Aimed at finding dancers who best embody the spirit of Michael Jackson on stage, the show will include competitors from all backgrounds - individuals and group performances. The winner won't necessarily be the dancer who simply mimics Jackson's choreography, but rather someone who can move like him, creating and inventing their own iconic steps and styles to most impress the judges and viewers. The series will open with two shows highlighting the good, the bad and brilliant auditions of the country's hopefuls, as well as interviews with some of Michael's friends and family. It will continue with three studio shows, two semi-finals, in which 16 contestants who were chosen from hundreds will have an opportunity to dance in front of the show's judging panel, including Jermaine Jackson and dance agent supremo Mark Summers, in a bid to make it into the last six and the live final. Another judge will be announced closer to transmission. The finalists will be guided through their studio performances by multi-award-winning choreographer and dancer Lavelle Smith Junior, who worked on Michael's Bad, Dangerous and History tours, as well as numerous videos. The winner will be chosen by the public and will win a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform at the official tribute concert, which is due to take place in London next June and will be hosted by Jermaine and the rest of the Jackson family and will include an array of global superstars.",
