He tells Jeremiah that he met Jeremiah's parents once, when he killed them, driving a semi truck. When Jeremiah will not give in and tell him where the cave and box are, the assassin brings in Claire, bound and gagged. He threatens to kill her if Jeremiah does not talk. Jeremiah realizes he cannot break his oath to protect the box and denies the assassin's request once more. As the assassin fires his gun at Claire, Jeremiah and Claire miraculously disappear, leaving the assassin all alone.    "
