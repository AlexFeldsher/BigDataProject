While there are a great many cat lovers in the world, there are also many that don't like them. She visits a cat show in Milton Keynes and notes that the crowd is made up of women and only a few men. Cats were once a sign of witchcraft which often resulted in both the cat and the owner being put to death. In Ypres, Belgium they threw live cats off tall buildings until 1814 and now at the cat festival throw stuffed cat toys in a reenactment. Cats were first tamed as pets in Egypt 3500 years ago...    "

But what price have cats paid in becoming the world's favorite pet? Originally, cats were encouraged for pest control purposes and seemed perfectly designed for the task. Their eyes are six times more sensitive to light and their sensitive whiskers let them feel their way ...    "
