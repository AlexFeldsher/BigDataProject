            "What happens when you're afraid to go out into the world but a twist of fate brings the unwanted world to you? Chen Mo-Mo ('Rainie Yang' (qv)) is a young woman who suffers from agoraphobia, which makes her feel anxiety in public places or in an overly crowded setting. So she doesn't like to venture out and prefers to stay in the safety of her home. But her safe haven becomes less so when she takes in Chuang Chun-Nan ('Jiro Wang' (qv)), a superstar who goes by the name \"Mars,\" as a tenant. Mars has hit financial rock bottom after a series of scandals and negative publicity."
