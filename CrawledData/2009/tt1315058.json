However the shared experience brings them closer and she comes to love him. Michael reappears,on his way to emigrate to Canada to avoid bigotry,but he spends a night with Queenie,who ends up pregnant. After he has gone Bernard returns,after being interned,and wants to make it up to Queenie and start again.
