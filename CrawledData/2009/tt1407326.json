Create a \"National AV Dermatological Foundation\", \"AV2 technology\", and \"Micro Biotics\", all based on aloe vera.The main character is Martin, who is forty-something, divorced, and Creative Director for BND, and often has hallucinations showing segments of life as ads. Bill is the new CEO of BND, who has come to re-organize the place, which he does on his first day there. Sumo and Kath are younger creative types. McBaney does most of the 'heavy lifting'. Marion is marketing director for Daiyonda automobiles, and must work with Martin on ads for her company. She tries to keep them honest, with limited success.Martin appears to be disillusioned with his work and personal life, and over the six episodes of the show we see his hallucinations and relationships with others, leading to a crisis in his life."
