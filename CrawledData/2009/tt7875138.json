One day, Cheng Yue tried to save a girl named Xiao Lu from a car accident, but unfortunately breaks his arm in the process and can no longer play the piano. Cheng Yue was devastated, and so she gave up music and chose to travel to get away. Two years later, Cheng Yue now lives in Shanghai and meets Xiao Lu, and the two become colleagues.

From being a person who has hit rock-bottom, wallowing in self-pity, he has re-ignited the passion in life. Cheng Yue falls in love with Xiao Lu, but he is rejected by her, why? Is their love fated to be a tragedy? Although they are not blessed, although they do not have a future, Cheng Yue still bravely loves Xiao Lu.",
