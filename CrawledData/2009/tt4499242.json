On the other hand, Yiu Kam Ling (Tavia Yeung) believes her survival in the palace is achieved through cruel and calculating tactics. She cheats and schemes her way to the top and finally becomes the concubine to the emperor. Though she realizes that Sam Ho has fallen in love with the chess master Ko Hin Yeung (Kevin Cheng), her jealousy is still aroused by Sam Ho's attraction to the Emperor Lee Yi (Moses Chan). Fearing that she is losing power, she ruthlessly makes up a false allegation against Ho of murdering the Empress (Mary Hon) and condemns her to death. No matter how cleverly she schemes, things do not go the way she planned.",
