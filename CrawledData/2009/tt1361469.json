            "Waybuloo is not just a series, its a philosophy for a happy life, and is like nothing children will have ever seen before.\nWaybuloo transports children into a magical land called Nara a real world, which is inhabited by adorable animated characters called Piplings. Taking a completely original approach, the series focuses on childrens feelings, and the Piplings embody a range of emotions including love, wisdom, happiness and harmony all in search of Waybuloo.\nThere are four Piplings.\nLau Lau is rabbit-like and her key characteristic is her imagination. She loves to paint and sculpt, especially if she can make presents for her friends.\nYojojo is monkey-like and represents happiness. He is clumsy, funny and cheeky. Just as Lau Lau loves to paint, Yo Jojo loves music and dancing. He even has a little stage carved from a tree stump on which to perform.\nDe Li is kitten-like and represents love. Shes a bit shy but is nurturing and loves nature, be it gardening, flowers or gathering food for the group.\nNok Tok is bear-like and represents wisdom. He solves problems and comes up with creative, inventive solutions for fixing and mending things. He has a very colourful toolbox and a special Anything Machine which can solve a multitude of problems.\nIn each episode, six children visit Nara to play with the Piplings and explore their land, as real life interacts with the animated world, showing that every child can visit Nara and find their own Waybuloo."
