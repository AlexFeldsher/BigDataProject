            "ANACOSTIA is the Daytime Emmy-winning dramatic digital series from creator Anthony Anderson, writer and producer of the critically acclaimed independent film THE TIES THAT BIND. The show, told in a ten-episode seasonal format following classic soap opera conventions, follows the lives of those living in or connected to the historic primarily African-American Anacostia community in eastern Washington D.C.In true soap opera fashion, the characters of ANACOSTIA spend their time navigating the ramifications of love, betrayal, deception, sex, and even murder. Each resident in the neighborhood has their share of painful secrets and personal vices, which, in concert, threaten to destroy the hard fought peace and tight-knit family comprising the community and all that surrounds it.At the center of the chaos, it seems, has always been the shrewd, manipulative, and abusive Michael Stephenson, who has never stopped at anything to get what he wants. Years ago, when Michael once again went too far, someone in his community decided to give Michael a taste of his own medicine, sparking a chain reaction with implications for each resident of the neighborhood...implications still felt today.ANACOSTIA's story trajectory has been one twists, turns, social commentary (and even, at times, controversy) in 10-episode packages that both work within familiar and beloved classic soap opera structure, with an injection of relevant, modern, and diverse approaches and themes to keep the series of the moment.The east-of-the-river (the Anacostia river) community of ANACOSTIA, with deep historic roots that exemplify the nation's historical evolution on issues of politics, development, race, class and the urban policy that results, has long been known as the \"forgotten part of D.C.\" in the public consciousness, but ANACOSTIA uses the digital dramatic medium to tell the heightened stories of the residents in a way that leaves the community forgotten no more."
