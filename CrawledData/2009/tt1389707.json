His father, David Garcia Sr., deserted his mother before he was born because his wife, Ingrid Garcia was pregnant with David \"Dave\" Garcia Jr. When Audrey King and her family went to Tagaytay for a visit, she fell from a set of high stairs. If it were not for David \"JR\" Garcia, who caught her, she probably would have died. When he gets help, she asks for his name. He tells her that he is David Garcia Jr. When she gets to the hospital and is asked who saved her, she says it's David Garcia Jr. David \"Dave\" Garcia Jr. is the one who is credited. She did not realize that he is a different boy. As she grows up falling in love with Dave, Dave meets his brother and soon best friend, JR. These two do not realize that they are brothers. Dave's grandmother, Elizabeth, suspects and so does JR's mother, Marlene, but nothing stops these two from becoming best friends. Audrey's father then sends her to Cebu to study there, but not before she meets JR. He feels like he has seen her before, but does not realize who she is. When Dave and JR were sent to the Philippine Military Academy, they started to get competitive with each other, in academics, and for their true love. When they finally got into battle, will brotherhood save them both, or will envy leave them both to die? Audrey has grown up in love with the wrong person, but when she realizes who her true savior is, will she be able to return his love?",
