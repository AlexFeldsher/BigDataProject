Overly confident success junkie Helena Delaney is given a second chance at success, running a TV network already populated with a dysfunctional staff of characters. It's a dream job, if she had a clue about country music. Which she doesn't. Helena thinks Big and Rich are, well... adjectives. Headhunted by her old lover and new boss Ellis Dukes, Helena is to rejuvenate the station that was left in shambles by their recently -- and literally -- committed ex-network head. Losing ground as she pushes into her 40s, Helena fights to stay ahead of the game, in love, life and work, mildly failing but often landing on her designer stilettos, a little worse for wear. Helena is determined to succeed, to bring the Network's numbers through the roof in the New Country boom, to gain respect from her employees and maybe to finally find true love. And the odds are against her.",
