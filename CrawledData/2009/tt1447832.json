Situation complicates when Dr Serdar also forms feelings for Narin but is unable to profess them.Will Narin return back Mustafa's love? will Mustafa succeed or loose her and his sanity? Will Doctor profess his love? Will Narin decide between Love and Duty towards family and honor? These are the themes explored in the series.The actions of Mustafa to attain Narin, Dr Serdars increasing attraction towards Narin and The troubles that plague Bulut family due to Mustafa's actions drive the plot of the series.\n"
