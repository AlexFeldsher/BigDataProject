        "plot outline": "Our hero, Lok Lambert, is an ordinary high school student with a knack for puzzles. While he's studying with classmate Sophie Casterwill, they happen to find a magic Amulet and a journal left behind by Lok's missing father. However, the evil Organization, a group of evil monster summoners called Seekers are after the book. They attack Sophie and Lok with their monsters, called Titans. Sophie is also a Seeker and is able to defend herself, but Lok is forced into a dangerous chase to protect the journal. They join up with master adventurer Dante Vale, who is a heroic Seeker with the Huntik Foundation. Sophie wants to help Lok, because her family's secret symbol is on the cover of the journal. She hires Dante Vale with her family fortune to help them find Lok's father and train them both to be master Seekers. As they follow the clues to Prague, they add a new Seeker to the team, a mysterious lone wolf named Zhalia Moon, and a mysterious little Titan with the ability to talk, Cherit. When the mission to find Lok's father reaches a dead end, Dante and Zhalia let Lok and Sophie come with them on official Huntik Foundation missions, giving them excellent opportunities to develop their Seeker powers and find new Titans to help them in battle. The Huntik Team repeatedly clashes with the Organization, the scheming chemist DeFoe, the by-the-book Grier, the mad scientist Klaus, the powerful and competent Rassimov and the ultimate leader, The Professor. They defeat DeFoe and Grier takes his place, but he turns out to be an honorable man who used his power as an Organization officer to stop a civil war in his home country. Klaus proves to be extremely dangerous, and even reveals that Zhalia has been his double agent all along. Luckily, disaster is averted when Zhalia's feelings for Dante and the others cause her to switch sides at the last minute. Finally, Dante, Lok and the others pick up the trail of Lok's father and it leads them right to the Professor, the Legendary Titans of Mind, Body and Spirit, and a powerful artifact called the Ancient Amulet of Will. However, when they go to confront The Professor, he is much more manipulative than they could have imagined. He manages to convince the unflappable Dante to give up his Legendary Titans with the promise that The Professor would be able to cure Dante's mentor, Metz. Lok is forced to take control of the mission and defeat The Professor himself.",

            "Lok and Sophie happen upon a journal left by Lok's father. The Organization, a group of evil Seekers, is after the book, and to survive they must join a group of good Seekers under master adventurer Dante and lone wolf Zhalia.::Sean Molyneaux",
            "Our hero, Lok Lambert, is an ordinary high school student with a knack for puzzles. While he's studying with classmate Sophie Casterwill, they happen to find a magic Amulet and a journal left behind by Lok's missing father. However, the evil Organization, a group of evil monster summoners called Seekers are after the book. They attack Sophie and Lok with their monsters, called Titans. Sophie is also a Seeker and is able to defend herself, but Lok is forced into a dangerous chase to protect the journal. They join up with master adventurer Dante Vale, who is a heroic Seeker with the Huntik Foundation. Sophie wants to help Lok, because her family's secret symbol is on the cover of the journal. She hires Dante Vale with her family fortune to help them find Lok's father and train them both to be master Seekers. As they follow the clues to Prague, they add a new Seeker to the team, a mysterious lone wolf named Zhalia Moon, and a mysterious little Titan with the ability to talk, Cherit. When the mission to find Lok's father reaches a dead end, Dante and Zhalia let Lok and Sophie come with them on official Huntik Foundation missions, giving them excellent opportunities to develop their Seeker powers and find new Titans to help them in battle. The Huntik Team repeatedly clashes with the Organization, the scheming chemist DeFoe, the by-the-book Grier, the mad scientist Klaus, the powerful and competent Rassimov and the ultimate leader, The Professor. They defeat DeFoe and Grier takes his place, but he turns out to be an honorable man who used his power as an Organization officer to stop a civil war in his home country. Klaus proves to be extremely dangerous, and even reveals that Zhalia has been his double agent all along. Luckily, disaster is averted when Zhalia's feelings for Dante and the others cause her to switch sides at the last minute. Finally, Dante, Lok and the others pick up the trail of Lok's father and it leads them right to the Professor, the Legendary Titans of Mind, Body and Spirit, and a powerful artifact called the Ancient Amulet of Will. However, when they go to confront The Professor, he is much more manipulative than they could have imagined. He manages to convince the unflappable Dante to give up his Legendary Titans with the promise that The Professor would be able to cure Dante's mentor, Metz. Lok is forced to take control of the mission and defeat The Professor himself.::Sean Molyneaux"
