            "Follows the lives of four health information workers and focuses on issues that affect every demographic, such as alcohol abuse and depression, and others that affect Latinos at disproportionally high rates, like diabetes and lack of insurance. Viewers are encouraged to call a toll-free number if they face the same issues the characters do on the show.In the first episode, a young woman known as \"La Chiquis,\" a nickname given to daughters who share their mothers' name, gets drunk at a party and insists on driving home. A man at the party persuades her to let him drive her home. On the way, she tries to wrestle the steering wheel from him and they collide with another vehicle, injuring a boy.A doctor tells them the boy suffered fractured ribs but, luckily for him, he qualifies for Child Health Plan Plus, a state program for uninsured children and pregnant women who can't afford private insurance but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.Lindsay said most people in Colorado who are eligible for public health insurance are Latino but are \"very hard to reach.\" Some 62 percent of Colorado children who qualify for the program and Medicaid are Latino. Almost 20 percent of Colorado's estimated 4.8 million residents are Latino."
