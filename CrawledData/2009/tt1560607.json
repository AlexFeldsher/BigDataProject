Can they fast track their over-protected brats into fully functioning, independent adults using real life challenges in just a few weeks? We're about to find out... Welcome to \"Your Kid\" a fresh and bold series where indulgent parents try to fast-track their inept and pampered teenagers into the real world. Eight teenagers who've been waited on hand and foot all their lives will compete against each other in tough challenges set by their parents to drag them kicking and screaming into adulthood. Then their pampering parents will get together to argue, plead and vote on who should stay and who is such a hopeless case they should leave the show. The winner will get the chance to actually, as well as figuratively, spread their wings, with an amazing round-the-world trip, which will mark their big step into the real world. And after a teary farewell to their parents at the airport gate, they'll step away from them for the first time in their life and take their first steps into adulthood. Indulgent mothers and fathers of the spoilt and the inept need to face up to the parenting job they've done and judge how well or badly their almost-adults fare as they are sent out into the real world. Viewers get to watch an amazing transformational journey as spoilt brats are turned into valuable members of the human race.",
