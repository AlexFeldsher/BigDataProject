            "The story of a group of British teens who are trying to grow up and find love and happiness despite questionable parenting and teachers who more want to be friends (and lovers) rather than authority figures.::gatetraveler",
            "Series One and Two focuses on a group of British teens trying to grow up and learn about love and life with little adult supervision (and lots of PARTYING). Sid tries to be everyone's friend and usually ends up on the short end of the stick. He is mostly manipulated by best friend Tony, whose girlfriend Michelle he is in love with. Tony is one to try anything once, including every girl he meets. He manipulates not only Sid and Michelle but anyone else who will let him. Anwar is just looking to lose his virginity, and though he is Muslim, it rarely stops him from partying excessively. Gay and popular friend Maxxie is along for the ride, while trying to pursue his dream of being a dancer and actor in London. Cassie, an anorexic basket-case, is in love with Sid, who overlooks her time and time again. Straight-laced Jal wants to focus on her musical ambitions.::gatetraveler",
            "Series three and four moves on to the next generation of _Skins_ (qv) with all their smoking, alcohol, drugs, arson, porn, teacher abuse, sex and glue. It focuses on Effy (Tony's younger sister introduced in previous episodes) and her friends. JJ, Cook and Freddie all fall for Effy. Emily and Katie are identical but totally different twins. Biggest difference: Katie likes boys and Emily likes girls, or just one girl in particular, Naomi.::Anonymous"

            "Taking every part of their adolescence, and manhood, nine different character portrait the life itself, living the pressure, creating a whole atmosphere for each story. Creating archetypes for the new Cinema era where everything become complex, deeper and darkness, this is a production that emphasise on the caption of reality, but something that Jamie Brittain and Bryan Elsey were creating was a new fresh-weight and colourful- lugubrious story; spending six years on writing the pictures of their own life, with problems, abyss inside the characters who destroyed themselves, progression, and a concept around the metaphor for the chapters, looking for freedom through their past.Through their parents, lovers and friends, in spite to choose the life, sometimes it gets natural because the sense of the four main characters who lead the other main supporting roles, in way of surrealism and modernism, whilst involving viewer to change the vision of life."
