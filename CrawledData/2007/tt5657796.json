            "Last year, more than 350 people got sick or died eating tainted spinach and lettuce. Others became ill after consuming peanut butter contaminated with salmonella. A recent pet food scare has many consumers worried if it could drastically affect human health. In Danger: Poisoned Food, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, investigates current threats to the nation's food supply all the way from the fields and farms to the packaging plants to the grocery store shelves. Dr. Gupta also exposes how the U.S. government's approach to these dangers may be putting Americans at additional risk.::CNN"
