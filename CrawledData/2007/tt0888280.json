As a mockumentary-styled comedy, the storyline is an embellishment of their real lives, and the fictional presence of a camera is often acknowledged. The show stars Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, the lead singer-songwriter and drummer, respectively. Nat's fictional female interest and real life friends - including the guitarist who had no prior acquaintance with the family - feature as the other band members, with the siblings' genuine father and Draper's husband as their widowed accordion-playing dad and Draper's niece as the group's babysitter.",

            "The hit Nickelodeon series depicts the daily lives of creator/showrunner Polly Draper's sons who lead a fictional world-renowned rock band in New York City. As a mockumentary-styled comedy, the storyline is an embellishment of their real lives, and the fictional presence of a camera is often acknowledged. The show stars Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, the lead singer-songwriter and drummer, respectively. Nat's fictional female interest and real life friends - including the guitarist who had no prior acquaintance with the family - feature as the other band members, with the siblings' genuine father and Draper's husband as their widowed accordion-playing dad and Draper's niece as the group's babysitter.::Eli Allen and Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"
