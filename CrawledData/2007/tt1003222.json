            "\"_As the Bell Rings_ (qv)\" focuses on the break time antics of the 6 key characters. The action takes place in a school corridor, just outside the head teacher's office and the window into their world is literally the window of the school building. The stars of 'As the Bell rings' use their break time to come up various schemes from winning a date with the prettiest girl in school to trying to captain every school club or team.::Anonymous"
