As part of the boy band club, they sang, danced, and for half a decade maintained a stranglehold on their massive and overwhelmingly female audience. But musical trends are fickle and change overnight and the boy band phenomenon couldn't last. Suddenly, a whole generation of former boy band heartthrobs found themselves looking toward life after 'teen idol-dom.' VH1's new series \"Mission: Man Band\" dares to ask the question, \"Can four grown up boy band heartthrobs join forces to capture new fame and fortune?\" Four boy band legends: Chris Kirkpatrick (N*SYNC); Jeff Timmons (98 Degrees); Rich Cronin (LFO) and Bryan Abrams (Color Me Badd) will live together for one month, create new music, a dynamic stage show and perform as a new pop group. Each member of the band finds himself at a different stage in his career. Some are confident, financially comfortable and just looking to make new music. Some have been forced to take a day job and still others may have faced profound life challenges like divorce and illness. Now with 20/20 hindsight, can they avoid the pitfalls of the past? If they are given all of the tools will they let go of old baggage, move forward and make fresh pop magic for a brand new audience? With a second chance at pop-stardom, will these former teen idols be able to transform their destiny or will their egos stand in their way? In the end, we will find out if our boy band alumni are able to recreate the magic that made them stars in the first place. See what happens when all that potentially stands in their way is themselves",
