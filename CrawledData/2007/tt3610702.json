We meet STEVE HILL, the home's resident animal behaviourist, who works with the more challenging rescue dogs, including Paddy, a large, aggressive Alsatian. We discover that it's not just cats and dogs that need a new home and join Kayla inside the small animal section where she talks to a family about rooming Damson, a lively ferret. In part two ...

        "plot outline": "The Bath Cats & Dogs Home is a unique community of people and animals. It's not only the largest rescue centre in the West, but it also re-homes more animals than any other RSPCA centre in the UK. Each year it takes in and cares for more than 3000 unwanted cats, dogs and small animals, and in the 67 years since it was set up, tens of thousands of animals have been saved from cruelty, homelessness and destruction. In spite of its record, it receives no public funding and relies for its income on adoption fees, legacies, charitable trusts, donations and fundraising events. At any one time the staff have approximately 125 dogs, 100 domestic cats, over 30 feral cats and a variety of small animals in their care. This year they've also had to cope with 100 chickens and 20 ferrets. The Home aims to find every animal a new loving home, no matter how long this may take. It acts as an adoption agency, animal hospital and funeral directors, and also provides temporary accommodation to pets which have been subject to maltreatment and whose owners are being prosecuted by the RSPCA. 'TELLING TAILS' is a three-part observational documentary series about life at the Home. It follows the work of key people, including the president, fund raising manager, vet, animal handlers and volunteers. Every day staff face new challenges as they care for animals and try to match them to suitable owners. We share the survival stories of individual animals, from when they're first rescued, through being nurtured back to health and ultimately re-housed. We also see how staff at the Home help to raise funds and interact with the wider community through taking part in key events including fundraising efforts such as the Bath half-marathon.",
