            "Men from all over the world have left their pasts to start a new life as elite soldiers in the French Foreign Legion. Director/Producer Elisabeth Nord has been granted unprecedented access to follow this legendary defence force from the inside. The Foreign Legion - Tougher Than The Rest looks beyond the myths and brutal reputation of the French Foreign Legion; portraying the legionnaires and their life in the Legion, this exploration reveals the true face of one of the most famous, mysterious and secretive fighting forces in the world. The French Foreign Legion is perhaps the greatest social experiment in the world, uniting 7,700 men of different social, cultural, religious, family and economic backgrounds from 136 countries around the globe, moulded together to form one phenomenal fighting machine. This fascinating documentary uncovers the true face and life of this legendary military unit - one of the most secretive and closed communities in the world. Seven years ago director Elisabeth Nord's brother decided to join the Legion, and although he was not admitted, it was a shocking experience that made her acutely aware of this different world - a place for men who seek brotherhood and fidelity to their comrades in arms, and a place where no women are allowed. For the first time in the Legion's 175 year history, a woman (Nord) has been granted unprecedented access to follow this legendary defence force from the inside, to trace the personal lives, relationships and the spirit of these elite soldiers. The foreign legionnaires have left their pasts, leaving their family and friends behind to start a new life and even get a new identity as professional soldiers in the Legion. Trained for intense military action, life as a legionnaire is an extreme adventure. The Foreign Legion - Tougher Than The Rest looks beyond the myths and brutal reputation; portraying the legionnaires and their life in the Legion, this exploration reveals the true face of one of the most famous, mysterious and secretive fighting forces in the world.::Editor"
