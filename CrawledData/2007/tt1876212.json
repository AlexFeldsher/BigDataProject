They introduce bee racing to the world, demonstrate how to coach goldfish to play football, and conduct a series of gourmet tastings with a very sophisticated urban fox. Who are they? Lloyd Buck is a professional bird trainer, and full time Essex boy Matt Thompson is a zoologist and enthusiastic goldfish trainer James Cooper is a prop designer and the team's mechanical genius This series is a privileged peek into their world. It's a world where ravens perform magic tricks, birds of prey chase \"scalextric\" mice, and slugs aren't a garden pest, but talented escape artists. All three men have an uncanny way with animals and a fascination with natural animal behaviour. Their mission is to celebrate the unsung talents of the creatures all around us.",
