This series tells the story of New Zealand art from earliest rock drawings to the present day. For the first time, viewers will be able to watch a substantial series documenting in detail some of the most significant art works of our history. The six one-hour episodes were several years in the making. Keith presents a personal, and at times controversial, view of New Zealand's cultural history, showing how artworks reflect the way we have shaped our lives. Eschewing 'art speak' in favour of plain language, Keith explores pivotal moments in our history through artworks that reflect the world in which they were made. The series documents an encounter between cultures and their development across the next centuries. Keith confronts New Zealand's 'cultural cringe' and the impact it has had on it's art history.",
