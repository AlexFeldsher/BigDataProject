Logan started another channel called SuperMarioLogan on December 6, 2007. He posted his first Mario video on December 8, 2007; SUPER MARIO GOT MILK. A parody of the old Got Milk Mario commercial from the commercials. Logan has made many videos after this one. Logan became very popular very fast on the Internet. He soon had a website and over 500 Subscribers in just a year or less. Logan is now 21 and still does plush videos except he does not post them very often.
