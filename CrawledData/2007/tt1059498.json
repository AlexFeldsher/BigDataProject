Fredo was raised alone by his Lola Cedes, who eventually turned senile and got lost when they moved to the city. In search of his Lola Cedes in the cruel city, Fredo meets new friends but also has a close brush with death in the hands of a ruthless syndicate. Left almost lifeless from a deadly beating, Fredo is rescued by Prof. Manalo, a scientist who invented the healing machine called the Regenerator. Fredo becomes the first \"guinea pig\" of the breakthrough healing machine and surprisingly acquires super-human powers. This fateful experience transforms the once helpless Fredo into an invincible crime-buster with extraordinary abilities and power.",
