This is how she meets Yoon Ho Sang in the hospital she's working at and starts pursuing him. However that's mostly a mix up, as Ho Sang was stuck there impersonating another guy as a favor and he's not actually rich. In fact, he's quite poor and irresponsible and due to an accident involving the other guy, he gets declared dead, too. Yet his family seems the better off because of it, so he leaves thinking it'll be a bigger disappointment for them if he turns out alive after all. With nowhere to go to, he thinks of an old flame of his, but Ha Na won't let go as easily and they both end up at her family's place, both knowing half the truth: she not knowing that he's poor, and he not knowing he's terminally ill.",

            "A Beautiful Love story Between a man (Yoon Ho-Sang) Facing death and a Women (Na Ha-Na)who Loves money more than anything.::HPSheikh",
            "Na Ha Na, a peculiar young woman raised in a funeral home and that loves money more than anything, concocts a plan to get hitch to a terminally ill rich fellow that'll die early and leave her his fortune. This is how she meets Yoon Ho Sang in the hospital she's working at and starts pursuing him. However that's mostly a mix up, as Ho Sang was stuck there impersonating another guy as a favor and he's not actually rich. In fact, he's quite poor and irresponsible and due to an accident involving the other guy, he gets declared dead, too. Yet his family seems the better off because of it, so he leaves thinking it'll be a bigger disappointment for them if he turns out alive after all. With nowhere to go to, he thinks of an old flame of his, but Ha Na won't let go as easily and they both end up at her family's place, both knowing half the truth: she not knowing that he's poor, and he not knowing he's terminally ill.::Dama del Puente"
