With the beginning of a new era of competition with other nations, but also new opportunities for the state's producers, Sonora has also consolidated an open, diverse and democratic political life. The tensions of the new millennium are seen in complex challenges such as the unemployment rate, the droughts, drug trafficking and global competition on the border. Academics, government officials and businessmen offer us a live portrait of what society hopes for and how they can and should confront the challenges that modernity imposes.",
