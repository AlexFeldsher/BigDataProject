Funnyman Robbie Coltrane (Cracker, Ocean's Twelve, the Harry Potter films) finds out as he takes to his country's scenic back roads on a quest for the quintessentially eccentric. Along the way, he meets the most unusual folks imaginable: a modern-day teenage wing-walker, a cleric who ministers to motorcyclists, a man who pops wheelies on a 20-ton monster fire truck, and more. He also witnesses a massive rugby matchplayed with a beer keg, a scarecrow convention, and even an explosion or two. Sometimes Robbie joins the fun--for instance, when he enters the world's only dock pudding cooking contest. (Of course, he cheats. ) So climb into the passenger's seat of Robbie's classicJaguar roadster, relax, and experience a Britain that you'll never see on the traditional tourist tracks.",
