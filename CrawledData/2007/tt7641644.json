The state was drawn into the rest of the nation by the railroad and growing demographic shifts during the years of Porfirio Díaz's reign, but the Revolution of 1910 would ultimately be the event that definitively integrated Sonora and its inhabitants into the Mexican nation. Sonora would provide the country with political and military leadership, headed by leaders such as Álvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías Calles. They would lead Mexicans from devastation to armed struggle, as well as through the nation's first years of economic, moral and political reconstruction.",
