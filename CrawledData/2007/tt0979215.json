Soon after their arrival they became extremely ill and were rushed to a hospital where they were diagnosed with Bubonic Plague. Due to concerns about possible bio-terrorism, John and Lucinda were isolated under intense security and became an international news item. John was placed in a coma and given a one per cent chance of survival. Lucinda recovered quickly, but remained in New York at John's side while he battled for his life.    "
