Unlike most twenty-somethings, the rest of the time they're worrying about running the country. _Party Animals_ (qv) takes a look at Westminster from the ground up - the young researchers and advisers shouldering huge responsibility in a frantic, high-stakes world. It's no wonder their personal lives are so messy. Starring Doctor Who actor Matt Smith."
