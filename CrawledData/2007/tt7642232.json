In the long run, it suffered the effects of the various economic crises that began in the 1970s, which also affected livestock raising and mining. This period's major issues are centered on phenomena such as migration and the establishment of border-area maquiladoras, which began transforming the state's production profile beginning in the seventies. The end of this era would be marked by the death of Sonora's Luis Donaldo Colosio in 1994.",
