Witness Jesus with his disciples at the Last Supper as He teaches by example that our life purpose is found in serving others. Episode 2: My Life can Change In Jesus' darkest hour, two of his closest friends turned their backs on him. Through the betrayals of Peter and Judas, we discover that in response to our sin we have the choice of repentance and life or despair and death. Episode 3: My Pain is Understood The journey to the cross was marked by betrayal, abuse, humiliation, loneliness, and agonizing pain. \"Because He Himself suffered when He was tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted.\" (Hebrews 2:18 NIV) Episode 4: My Life has a Plan Imagine the thoughts and emotions of Mother Mary as she witnessed Jesus' journey on the road to Golgotha. Watch as she struggles to reconcile giving birth to the Son of God with the scene of His imminent death. Did God really have a plan for her life? What of the life of her perfect, precious Son? Episode 5: I Have the Promise of Eternal Life The heart of the gospel message is powerfully presented as we experience the crucifixion and death of Christ. Through the interaction between Jesus and the thief on the cross, we find ourselves in Jesus' plan of salvation. Episode 6: I have a hope that never dies Mary Magdalene's miraculous experience at the tomb of Jesus is filled with a new message of hope and the promise of eternal life. Through her story, we rejoice in the reality that nothing can ever take from us the hope we have in Christ.",
