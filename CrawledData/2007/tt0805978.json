Host 'Ira Glass' (qv) (who's pulling double-duty on the TV show as he's also the host on radio) and a team of filmmakers spend months on the road finding stories they think would be interesting to viewers -- stories involving Iowa pig farms, an Illinois hot-dog stand and a man who spends several hours a day in his family's mausoleum, among other tales. Many of the stories featured on the show were originally told on the radio show, with video added for the TV audience.::Jwelch5742"
