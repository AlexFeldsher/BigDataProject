Each week, hustler Alexis Conran takes on three intense challenges against world class experts, to see if he can find a way to beat them at their own game, without going through years of hard work and training. In any normal head-to-head contest, Alexis wouldn't have a chance, but he will travel the World and look into science and technology as well as calling on his hustling skills to see if he can find a way to come out on top. His ultra-competitive nature, and desire to win at all costs means he won't give up until he thinks he has a way to be victorious. He then shares the techniques and tricks he used in his attempt to beat the expert, whether that's a sporting champion, a Professor or even the World's Strongest Man.",
