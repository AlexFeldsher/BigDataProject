            "THE WRITERS' BLOCK season two is a ten-episode digital series that premiered on CBC Comedy in March 2018. Created by David Benjamin Tomlinson and Matt Watts, and produced by Frantic Films, THE WRITERS' BLOCK finds a writing team (Showrunner AURORA and writers DAVID and MATT) in production on their new series Somerset Isle. As the trio work tirelessly to deal with script deadlines and network interference (there's an ugly rumour going around that network executive ANDREW DORIAN wants to make the season finale a musical) their personal lives become increasingly complicated. Aurora is facing the demands of raising a young son and caring for her mother, who may or may not be dealing with early on-set dementia. David has started an ill-advised relationship with TROY (a young actor in the cast), which jeopardizes the integrity of the writers' room; and Matt is wondering where his passion went and entertaining a job offer which could tear the writer's room apart."
