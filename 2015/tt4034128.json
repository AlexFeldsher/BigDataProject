It's not that Dane doesn't care, or doesn't want to protect the world from the most nefarious of costumed supervillains who roam the streets at night, he's just not very good at it. But what Dane lacks in secret agent talent, he more than makes up for with his love for the good life. Dane often finds himself in the company of his best friend, Chuck - a 5 foot tall furry blue monster in a Hawaiian print shirt. Chuck is as skilled at secret agenting as Dane is awful, and somehow manages to pull his friend back from the brink of disaster each time Dane gets into a situation he just can't manage.",
