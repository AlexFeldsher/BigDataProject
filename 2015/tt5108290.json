The great director has raised a city \"Andriccity\" (\"Andricgrad\") - in honour of Andric - where some segments of the series were recorded. Besides Kusturica, the director of the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Academy - Odd Zschiedrich also talks in the series, as well as eminent historians, writers and diplomats from Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
