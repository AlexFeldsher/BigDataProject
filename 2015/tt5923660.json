            "This lyric romance tells the love story between two mature people a teacher Alexandra (Mariya Kulikova) and a former pilot Evgeniy (Oleg Shtefanko). They are similar in their disappointment in family life, disorder in everyday life, and readiness to rush to help the weak and oppressed. They are charming, but often touchingly awkward, they both raise their children on their own: Alexandra - her son Sasha, Evgeniy - his daughter Jenya. Once met at school, by force of circumstance the characters begin to see each other regularly. And gradually they realize that their encounter is a beginning of a big and strong feeling. For which theyll have to fight. Many things seem to be against this love: the age gap, Evgeniys obsession with his daughter, who is deprived of maternal affection, his conflict with his eldest son Vasiliy, the intrigues of Alexandras ex-husband (Konstantin Solovyov). But the namesake of their parents - Sasha and Jenya - will aid much to draw the main characters together. The boy is excited about Evgeniy once a brave pilot, a real man in behaviour: sparing of words, firm in action. And Jenya becomes sincerely attached to Alexandra who surrounds the girl with care and affection..."
