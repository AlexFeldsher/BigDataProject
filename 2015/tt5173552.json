Everyday people and their interesting \"everyday\" stories are the core of this story, as well as its striking episodic characters who appear straight from the margin to pub \"_Dojc Caffe_ (qv)\", where they try to sell their dreams to three best friends. Their friendship remains strong and intact in spite of each failure or business downfall and overcomes every trouble that crosses path with one of the three friends. Its humor constantly explores and examines the relations between friends, and enemies, as well as the relation towards tradition, past and future times, current events and forced trends of young people."
