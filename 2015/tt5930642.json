He also knows that graduating without a meaty lead role under his belt could leave him wasting his prime years chasing auditions for student films instead of building the kind of resume he can be proud of. Unfortunately, the college has hired recent alumni - and budding Hollywood action hero - Morgan Othello to direct the play. And Othello, in turn, has filled the cast with his friends, including handing the role of Hamlet to Desmond Omah, with whom Othello is secretly romantically entangled. In order to remove Omah, Jacob - from his perch as understudy to the lead - aims to oust both Othello and Desmond, in order to secure the role he knows he deserves. Aided by his friend (with benefits) Rodrigo, Jacob begins to build a labyrinthine plan that will either secure him exactly what he desires, or ruin him - and all those around him, including his devoted sister Emily - in the process.",
