Over the course of three months the recruits are transformed from an unfit but willing group of civilians into a strong unit of fledgling soldiers. The cameras follow the recruits inside and outside the camp as the young men return home to be reunited with their parents, wives, children and friends. But it's inside the camp where the real transformation occurs. Each young man undergoing a journey of self-discovery, developing both physically and mentally and forming lifelong friendships along the way. A group of wealthy pampered civilians, transformed into a disciplined band of brothers.",
