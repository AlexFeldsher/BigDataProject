Set in Atlanta, GA, Season 1 of the new series features some of R&B's most talented emerging male singers and songwriters such as Kameron Corvet, Richard King, and former childhood actor and buzzing singer, Mishon - each of who pose as love interests for the cast members of the promising show. Introducing you to new sounds from the above artists as well as a few other up and coming talents, the series serves as a way to not only release new music, but also give artists a way to tap into other talents that they may have. Taking inspiration from Sex and the City and Girlfriends mixed with the comedic relief of the 1997 film B*A*P*S, this scripted series delves deep into the minds of both women and men and sheds light on what may or may not cause a chain reaction of events in relationships.",
