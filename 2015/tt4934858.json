            "Behind the Wool is a weekly web series produced by Cheap Sheep Studios. Hosted by Ezra Espenida and Frankie Batista, and currently in it's first season. These two hosts discuss everything from feature films presently in the theaters, as well as debate about movies due out. Another nice segment is that they offer reviews of short films produced by independent film makers. Of course we would fall well short of our discussion if we did not mention Gabriel. The third member of the cast, Gabe is well...Gabe. There are many ways to describe Gabe, but it's better if you tune in, all in good fun though. A new episode is released every Thursday on YouTube at around 10pm (Pacific Standard Time). So, if you have not checked them out, you are invited to watch them out on YouTube, listed as Cheap Sheep Studios. While there subscribe, you wont be disappointed."
