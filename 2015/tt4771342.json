            "The Story revolves around lives of Yousuf and Zulaikha. Yousuf is a singer who sees Zulaikha in a train for the very first time and is unable to get her out of his mind. Zulaikha on the other hand, considered the moment as a momentary attraction as she is stuck between her cousins marriage proposals, masked by the personal interests of her parents. She bumps into Yousuf once again who is evidently in love with her and is expressive about his feelings for her. Later, Noor Muhammad (Zulaikha's Father) announces her marriage with Imran Moeez (his nephew) so he himself can marry Imran's Aunt Bushra. At this moment Yousuf crosses every single limit to prove his love to Zulaikha so she can deny marring Imran. Story takes turn when Yousuf is increasingly being tortured by the police upon Noor Muhammad's orders, at this point Zulaikha becomes aware that his love was always true for her. Looking to this Zulaikha eventually falls in love with Yousuf. Afiya Begum (Zulaikha's mother) and Hajira (Zulaikha's sister) then start to support her to marry Yousuf while Noor Muhammad stars threatening Zulaikha, he however marries Bushra successfully. Dark pasts are then revealed to Yousuf and Zulaikha conveying that both are not made for each other and separation is in their destiny despite this both show reluctance and tend to name their love. The Story is now penned on the challenges and tortures they face for their love. It will also be shown how Afiya stands against Noor Muhammad and avenges herself and her daughters whereas Zulaikha gets divorce from Imran::M.S"
