Amadé Swappach, Kossuth's army major and her freshly eloped lover Estella set out on a journey with a chest full of \"bejgli\", a charioteer and a meddling countess to Debrecen to investigate a suspected capital treason. The strange quartet make haste to arrive at their destination on an arbitrarily sequestrated diligence. Unbeknownst to them, they are scoured after by a hearse, with half a day's lagging. Besides Swappach's father - head of the imperial espionage organization, impelled by vengeance - and Estella's sire - the pastry cook Demeter Vödricz, driven by care - another spy, Dalfalvi, is on board the \"Pompes Funébres\". On occasion the two chariots miss each other by mere hours, their passengers even spending the night in the same town - only in two different inns. The one thing both parties have in common, nevertheless, is that their journeys lead them through surprises, and unexpected, exciting, flabbergasting adventures, while the war of independence rages on around them. Will the Pompes Funébres catch up with the diligence eventually? Is everybody to survive, when it does? And will the \"bejgli\" make it to Debrecen? The 6-part mini-series based on the novel by Béla Fehér takes us back to the times of the 1848/49 revolution and war for independence. From Bratislava through Érsekújvár, and Vác to Debrecen our heroes will encounter magical creatures, lost souls, and many a strange entity - while we poise with them on the verge of reality and imagination, traveling down a road of specters, fairies, and animate objects.",
