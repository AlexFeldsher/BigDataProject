Yet, as all good cooks know, there's always a story behind the recipe, and we will get to see that story. Sy has dreams of one day opening a restaurant... and one day asking out Rosanna, one of his best friends. But that's a little complicated because Sy is afraid to lose the friendship that they do have, and he is very self-conscious about the huge glasses he wears to curb his terrible eyesight. On top of Sy's quest for Rosanna, there's also Sy's friend, Reggie, who needs Sy's help with a school project. Then there's Chef Montay, the school cook who is a mentor to Sy. And Nicole, the perpetual thorn in Sy's side, a girl on a mission to destroy Sy based on a misunderstanding. And let's not forget Rosanna, she's not just a prize to be won - she has her own dreams, too.
