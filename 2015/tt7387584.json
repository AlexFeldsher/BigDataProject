The film is an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel, and the first time the author's work has been set to screen. Set in the 1970s, Inherent Vice follows the paranoid, drug-addled misadventures of an LA detective (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who is chasing a case brought to him by an ex-girlfriend about her boyfriend, his wife, and a plot to kidnap a billionaire.
