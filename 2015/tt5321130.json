They only have three months to explore the vast and rugged wilderness of Pitt Lake before winter weather sets in. So they quickly determine which six locations hold the most promise, and set off to investigate two of them: one backed by First Nations oral history, the other a secret location that might be linked to a fabled prospector's letter. Working together for the first time, the group starts to realize what they're up against - danger-filled locations, unreliable leads, not enough time, and delusional over-enthusiasm fuelled by gold fever. They set off on a challenging treasure hunt in the BC mountains - but when fights break out, they wonder if the team will even last the summer.",
