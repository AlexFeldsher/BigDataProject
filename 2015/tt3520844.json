Each week viewers will enter the lives of committed animal welfare advocates as we track the progress of rescued animals from rescue/acceptance into the shelter, through rehabilitation and then finally on to adoption. Characters range from animal technicians to veterinarians to foster coordinators to volunteers. GIVE ME SHELTER truly puts the viewers in the middle of a no-kill rescue shelter. From rescue runs to save imperiled animals, to successful adoption events, to the private thoughts of the characters involved, the audience will intimately experience it all.",
