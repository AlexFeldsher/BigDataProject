Gul has always gone on a holiday with her family but she has longed to go on a trip by herself, explore a place without any assistance. Having owned a Mahindra Scorpio, her trusted adventure Jeep she decided to build an unstoppable vehicle on a Mahindra Scorpio Getaway platform. Gul Panag got in touch with her friend, Jaskirat from Sarbloh Motors, explained her requirements to him who then customized the Scorpio to Supermilo. The jeep is a reincarnation of her long lost travel companion, Milo- the beagle, whom she lost on one of such adventure trips. Supermilo seemed like the perfect vehicle that satisfied her needs to take on an adventurous journey that required the specifications the jeep offers. Swati, on the other hand, has always been a career oriented woman who always had a will to travel but has never been able to make time for it. Since the time Gul and Swati have been friends they have always spoken about travelling together. The journey to Leh-Ladakh was perfectly timed for Gul to take on an adventure without any constructive aid and for Swati to break out of her shell and finally travel taking a break from her hectic schedule.",

            "Episode 1 - The first leg of Gul Panag's Ladakh Run covers her journey from Chandigarh to Tso Kar. While Gul introduces Swati to the world of adventure, their misadventures are compounded by missed deadlines. Improvising and making friends with local wildlife, Gul drives along the ever changing and awe-inspiring mountainous terrain through slush, water bodies and dirt tracks. Episode 2 - Gul Panag's Ladakh Run continues from Tso Kar to Leh. A healthy compromise is reached between the ladies to satiate Gul's appetite for adventure and Swati's reluctance - by exploring the picturesque town of Leh, running a marathon, kayaking, rafting and driving through the world's highest motorable pass to the high altitude desert of Hundar! Episode 3 - The final leg of the Gul Panag's Ladakh Run, covers her journey from Leh to Hanle via the astonishingly beautiful Pangong Tso lake. Bringing to television for the first time areas of Ladhakh that have not been exposed to film, Gul takes you to the world's highest observatory at Hanle as well as some of the oldest monasteries before she finds out that her adventures are far from over."
