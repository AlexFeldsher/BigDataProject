Winds of almost 300 kmh, constant daylight, temperatures as low as minus 86 celsius and a steadily increasing altitude up to the equivalent of 4,000m. If that wasn't enough, they must survive each other's company, day in and day out, for up to 45 days. Have they got what it takes to win the race?",
