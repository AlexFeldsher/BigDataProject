Several military pilots have encountered unknown phenomena while on duty, especially during the heat of the Cold War. Some actually tried engaging the objects in combat. But were any of them bona fide alien aircraft? By examining decades of recently opened government UFO investigations, and interviewing leading experts and pilots who lived through the sightings, we attempt to separate the explainable from the extraterrestrial.
