Each couple is dropped in various locations around the world, from a tropical jungle in Mexico, to a frozen mountain in Norway, and each couple is responsible for finding the raw materials fort building a fire and a shelter. Then they have to find some kind of food source, hopefully enough to sustain them for the three weeks they are out there, and then they have to travel from their drop point to their extraction point to go home. If at any time, one or both of the people can't handle the situation, they can tap out and be removed from the game.::J.P. Donnelly"
