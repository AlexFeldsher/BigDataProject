        "plot outline": "\"Beginnings\" - Father Merrin is called away from preaching at schools to help investigate a suicide that has links to the church. He finds himself at odds with the skeptical Lt. William Kinderman. For assistance, he is later paired with Sister Manning, who is clinging to her faith after falling victim to an attack, and Lance Corporal Spader, an army man retired by injury who now privately bodyguards. As more people begin to take their own lives, Merrin traces the source of the madness to Africa. \"Revelations\" - Now working as a team, Lance Corporal Spader, Sister Manning and Father Merrin are alarmed to find that a statue of Pazuzu originating from Iraq has already found its way to the United Kingdom on the rouge ship of Captain Howdy, and may be the source of the demons growing power. But locating it provides more questions as the town it resides in now appears to have become a haven of unprecedented peace, with no crime or violence, since it's arrival. \"Resolutions\" - Pazuzu makes its big move, and religions of all kinds in the United Kingdom begin to turn on each other as the country threatens to descend into religious riots. Sister Manning joins the few campaigning for peace, while Lance Corporal Spader teams up with other retired soldiers to defend his home city of London. Lt. William Kinderman hunts for the one person who has faced Pazuzu before, while Father Merrin will now face the demon beneath the streets of London to exorcise it not just from it's human form, but from the mortal world. The answer lays not in today, but back in the year 1974.",
