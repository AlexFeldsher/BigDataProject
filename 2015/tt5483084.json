        "plot outline": "The Story has its roots in a future world that centers on the Virtu dynasty's intrigues, a family of Gods battling for the Kingship of the living world. Set in the small town of Puregate in 2026 after the great crash, in a world so close to ours but so different. It is a future bound together by suffering and hardship where there is a war on consciousness, love is regulated and children are adopted by the State. In such a world, often on the brink of collapse, the citizenry have to be kept placid and content. They have to be kept from dreaming too much. So their dreams are stolen and used for the amazing powers they contain. At the same time the conflict among the Virtu's is forming. All eyes are upon the throne. Whoever sits on the throne of Dreams, can control the dreams of the world, and thus the power to direct the course of mankind. But battle in the dream world has its own rules, where fantasies can turn to nightmares and the shadows may come alive. Dante, who was conceived 35 years before in Puregate returns to his birthplace as an unknown heir to the throne, usurped by his murderous uncle Narke, he must decide his fate. To do nothing and possibly face being murdered as his father was, or to fight and vanquish his uncle to become King. The family and their allies are choosing sides, and a war for the throne is brewing.",
