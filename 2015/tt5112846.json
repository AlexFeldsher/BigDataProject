        "plot outline": "Follows eight of the hottest young dancers, ranging in age from nine to 15, as they train in every genre imaginable with top hip-hop dancer and choreographer, Kiki Ely, at her Atlanta studio, \"ATLA Takeova.\" She and her assistant, BeeJay Harris, a professional dancer for 12 years, offer the kids Master Dance classes and prepare them for a variety of entertainment auditions and professional engagements, ranging from film and TV to music videos and concert tours in Atlanta - a city on the cutting edge of dance and choreography. Each episode of \"Dancin' The Dream\" will follow one or two of \"Ely's kids\" as they juggle their family lives, schoolwork and professional dance training. At times, the kids will work as a team on special performances, booked gigs or in competition against other dance studios. Other times, they'll be asked to compete against each other for one coveted spot in a show. Ultimately, Ely and Harris have forged these kids and their parents into \"a band of brothers\" who work together to achieve their dreams. The stakes are high, as most of these families fully support their kid's shot at the big time. But no matter what the assignment, the kids, their parents and mentors will come together at the end of each episode for a final, jaw-dropping performance. The high-energy, exuberant performances may include a sudden flash mob for a charity event, a reinterpretation of a famous dance performance, dancing backup for a celebrated singer, or a music video that highlights an up-and-coming artist. Ely started her career as a young dancer in Atlanta and has since toured the world with some of the top names in the music industry, including Christina Aguilera, Ciara, Christina Milian, Brooke Valentine and others. A former choreographer and member of the Atlanta Hawks Dance Team, Ely has also choreographed for countless music videos and films, including \"Drumline,\" starring Nick Cannon, Zoe Saldana and Orlando Jones.",
