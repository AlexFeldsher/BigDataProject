This is the George you always wanted but were afraid to bring up at the dinner table for fear that Grandpa would write you out of his will and Mother would call in an exorcist to expel the demon comedy seed deep within your twisted soul. George is still a big-hearted, Jungle King who throws himself into his job like any teenage boy would - with boundless enthusiasm and reckless abandon. One minute he's defending the jungle from an air assault by a patrol of WWII flying squirrels, the next, he's moving all the animals into mole tunnels during the yearly jungle fumigation. George may not understand civilization but no one understands his jungle the way he does. Like, who knew that shaving stripes off zebras turns them invisible? George! And who knew that pink flamingos are the toughest mobsters and the best ballroom dancers in the jungle? George! Oh sure, crazy plans lead George and his pals into ridiculous situations and crazy detours that drive everyone in the animal kingdom bananas. But in the end, George always rises above the mayhem and saves the day with bizarre George logic that twists expectations and delights audiences. In other words, everything you love about George is here, just louder and prouder",
