Each piece stands as an individual 'moment in time' that highlights how Shakespeare (and his fellow Elizabethan playwrights) were talking about issues and ideas that we are still debating and experiencing today. The takeaway? This series shows that Shakespeare speaks to us now just as strongly as he did 400 years ago when he first put quill to parchment. _Shakespeare Republic_ (qv) - all the world's a stage .::Incognita Enterprises"
