Both Uffe Elbæk, for many years of surprise, becomes a minister of culture as he chooses to resign as minister for the sake of his husband Jens, when he is cleansed by the National Audit Office for accusations of incompetence and nepotism and, as a non-attached person, he collects volunteers in secret and the party seeks the option that comes into the parliament with nine mandates. Furthermore, the series provides a rare insight into the function of the office and in the media's handling of politicians and politics. - Is Uffe Elbæk naive or visionary? Were the media too far in their opposition to Uffe Elbæk? Does the interaction between politics and media deserve to be viewed with far more critical eyes? These are some of the questions Bonke and Søgaard want to pass on.",
