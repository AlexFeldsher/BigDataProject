Since then, Nina's life changes abruptly: mysterious attackers are chasing her.

But when the criminals kill Nina's ex-fiance and kidnap her mother, Skvortsov becomes her major ally and protector. But not only Nina is in danger: the main goal of the bandits - the murder of the president of the state company \"RosNanoIndustry\". And no one except the heroine can prevent the crime.",
