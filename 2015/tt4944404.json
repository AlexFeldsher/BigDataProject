What is unclear, is whether or not Mace has actually lived multiple lifetimes, or if he's just an old soul stuck in a modern world. In any case, his massive accumulation of knowledge, skills and experience certainly make it seem as if he's had more than a single lifetime of learning, while his penchant for 1940s style seems to hint at his unwillingness to keep up with the times. It's often difficult to know whether he's stuck in time, or if he simply got tired of trying to keep up with the changes around him. Alternating between an incredibly modern savvy for all things technical and a seemingly outdated social view... Mace can be at times both awe inspiring and exasperating... especially if you're a woman. What is never in doubt however, is his uncanny ability to solve the most baffling criminal mysteries. \"Time... when it's all you have left, it may just be your worst enemy.\"",
