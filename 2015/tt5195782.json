But as soon as she removes the medical gauze, Zhong Li realizes that her face has completely changed-she has just become a doppelganger of Lou Xiaoqian, China's #1 top star. What lies ahead of her is the stardom she had always wanted. But what she did not expect is the horror of discovering that Lou was a spy and she has taken her place. She's now controlled by a secret organization and is forced to execute dangerous missions. How many more times can she escape from death? She has no one to turn to except herself.",
