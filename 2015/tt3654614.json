Whilst his boss is happy with a conviction of 3Kgs of cocaine, Ash wants a larger criminal. During the subsequent operation, Tommy is severely injured in a resultant car accident, and Ash is then suspended. Subsequently he is approached in a pub by Cartwright (Stewart), the head of top-secret UNIT (Undercover Narcotics Investigation Team). On first entering UNIT's HQ he meets a familiar face, his Customs training officer Valerie (Ashbourne).::Soumik Ghosh"
