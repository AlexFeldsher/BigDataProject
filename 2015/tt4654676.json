            "MISS TERI is a new comedy about three misfit musicians who look to the stars to find their way. Dan is a single, young female musician living the painful cliche of a starving artist. After consulting with her astrologist mother, Dan refocuses all her attention on her band, Ben-ya. Along with her bandmates - aspiring badass-friend Meta, and her cocky roommate Brodie - Dan struggles with the question: does knowing your future give you control, or does it take it away? Can you plot your own astrological course? Each day poses a new challenge, and a new horoscope, that more often than not, comes painfully true."
