Up Late NW is hosted by Emmy Award winning Northwest television personalities Pat Cashman and Chris Cashman, who are a father (Pat) and son (Chris) team. Each weekly, half-hour episode is shot before a live studio audience at Fremont Studios in Seattle, Washington; and features pre-recorded digital sketch comedy shorts, live audience interactions, special celebrity guests, and performances by both Northwest stand-up comedians and musical guests. Guests have included: Jeff Probst, Joel McHale, Kenny Mayne, Danny Bonaduce, Roger Fisher, Shawn Kemp, Luke Willson, Taylor John Williams, and many more. It is often considered a successor to the Seattle-based productions of Almost Live! and The (206), mostly because of the involvement of Pat and Chris Cashman. Up Late NW is a production from production company, Artists think Tank, LLC. Pat Cashman and Chris Cashman are co-executive producers with showrunner B Anthony Nelson. Up Late NW is the highest rated original regional (non-news) program in America, and reaches audiences throughout Washington, Oregon, Northern Idaho and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",
