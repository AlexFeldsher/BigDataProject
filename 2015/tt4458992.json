            "The series follows Dan and Michelle Hamill as they raise their three children, Jack, Cece and Cate. All five family members have achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, but Michelle and Dan are committed to making sure their kids feel confident in their own skin. In the first season of OUR LITTLE FAMILY, viewers got an inside look into the Hamills lives from potty training and soccer games to special anniversaries and holiday celebrations. The family celebrated the twins third birthday, and they also dressed up for the first time as a family for Halloween, setting up new traditions for the kids. In the new season, Dan and Michelle will share more of their life at home as the kids are getting older. From theme park excursions to family vacations, life in the Hamill house has never been more fun."
