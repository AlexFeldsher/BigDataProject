            "When Doc, the beloved owner of Buster's, an SEC campus dive bar, passes away suddenly, a group of his favorite patrons discover the bar has been left to them in his will. Of course, along with the inheritance of the place comes a whole slew of problems, and it's up to the new owners to fix them. So now, five strangers who have each sort of lost their way, are on a path none of them expected. But sometimes, it takes a bad idea to get back on track, right? Bickering ensues, accusations are made and secrets are revealed. Amidst the chaos, friendships are renewed, old flames are rekindled, and new ones ignite. There is one thing they all agree on though: How much they all loved Doc, and how important it is to honor his wishes!Welcome to the South, y'all. It's about God, family and football. But not necessarily in that order!"
