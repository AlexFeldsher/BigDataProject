            "Mack & Moxy partners with Americas leading non-profit organizations to teach children about important causes like Hunger Awareness, Early Childhood Education, Saving Wild Animals, Emergency Preparedness, or Autism.By combining 3D animation, live-action puppets, fun adventures, good-hearted humor and catchy music, Mack & Moxy teaches children life-long lessons of charity and compassion, while celebrating the joy of helping others.In each episode, MACK, a loveable, moose-like lummox, and MOXY, a feisty whirlwind of a raccoon/fox-inspired entrepreneur, set out to rescue another Great Helpee in a mystical place called HelpeeLand. Along the way, Mack & Moxy meet a FRIEND-IN-NEED, a resident character of HelpeeLand, who is in some way connected to the episodes cause. This could be a bird-like creature who has autism, a corn-stalk kid who needs to escape a burning building, or a tiger-like tyke who wants to save his home. The Friend-In-Need not only receives assistance, but offers it as well.Together, they all set off to rescue The Great Helpee while discovering meaningful and exciting ways they will help each other!\n"
