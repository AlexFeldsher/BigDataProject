            "Mika is known for her conservative nature, whereas her husband Tony perceives the world rather mellow. However, in the eyes of their friends the two of them are the perfect family couple.\nEverything changes when the architect finds that her husband, the marriage counselor, has an affair. Mika is really shocked, but decides to keep her cards closed. She is forced to change her old fashioned view about marriage and enrolls in a course for geishas, taught by a popular sexologist, who becomes her friend.\nThe two of them become extremely close. Mika absorbs any advice related to the subject of how to get rid of the bitch. Up to the day when she finds out that her sex mentor is namely her husbands mistress.\nImminent danger is casting shadow over Tony too. He has violated the professional ethics. He has revoked the sexologist from a notorious underground boss after a series of consultations of the couple in his office. Tony is forced to find the balance between lies in the family and defense of his personal and professional life, if these secrets get revealed.\nFollowing their common desire to return to each other, Mika and Tony form a quiet battlefield. There are no hostages in it, but there is no mercy either. In the process of her liberation Mika falls over her new client charismatic, temperamental and extremely jealous underground boss, whose house she is expected to furnish. Ironically, he occurs to be the sexologists ex-boyfriend and also a former client of Tony.\nAt the same time, the relations in Tonys love affair also become complicated. Tony is entrapped in the absurd situation to look for salvation from his mistress with his wife. But Mika is no longer sure that she can stay with him. Unless, if some extraordinary circumstances bond them back together. Like, for example, one very real corpse."
