Although she treats gang member clients like \"scum\", she goes far beyond her responsibility to help them quit the organization by getting a written agreement from the gang boss and finding jobs for them afterwards. Also, her colleague and a former detective at the Organized Crime Department, Mikajima Kakeru doesn't get along with Bakushu. One day, \"Clean Break Helpline\" receives a call from a client. He is the leader of a gang group under the umbrella of a designated organized crime group \"Kanto Kifune Gumi\", and claims that he already made an apology to the boss of Kanto Kifune Gumi, Tachibana Isao. The client says that his group has got in trouble because of Bakushu.",

Although she treats gang member clients like \"scum\", she goes far beyond her responsibility to help them quit the organization by getting a written agreement from the gang boss and finding jobs for them afterwards. Also, her colleague and a former detective at the Organized Crime Department, Mikajima Kakeru doesn't get along with Bakushu. One day, \"Clean Break Helpline\" receives a call from a client. He is the leader of a gang group under the umbrella of a designated organized crime group \"Kanto Kifune Gumi\", and claims that he already made an apology to the boss of Kanto Kifune Gumi, Tachibana Isao. The client says that his group has got in trouble because of Bakushu."
