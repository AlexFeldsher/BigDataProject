Each video aims to cultivate empathy and understanding from a wider audience that may be unfamiliar with the history of collectivist tyranny, dramatizing each witness's experience and wisdom in an easily understood personal narrative. Smock Media has found that this approach is much more effective at drawing viewers into the reality of these stories rather than numbing the audience with a catalog of unspeakable horrors from yesteryear that may shock but ultimately are so outside viewers' personal experiences that they fail to truly inform the audience's worldviews.",
