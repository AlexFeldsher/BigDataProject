Guo Dongsheng has already fallen in love with Shen Lian gradually. Shen Lian died and the daughter realized the goodness of life. Middle-aged Guo Dongsheng also completed his transformation as a father. The father and daughter tear up the contract, eliminate unpleasantness and hug each other tightly.",
