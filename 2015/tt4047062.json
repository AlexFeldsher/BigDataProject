This animated pre-school series features best friends Sydney the Sailboat and Zip the Water Taxi as they learn how to ride the waves of life alongside their fleet of friends in bustling Bubble Bath Bay. Sydney and Zip are full of enthusiasm and always ready to help. But first they need to learn the ropes! And when youre an accident-prone little yacht who often launches before he looks, or a zippy little motorboat revving into action at the drop of an anchor, thats not as easy-breezy as it sounds. Terry the Tugboat (voiced by Australian actor Colin Friels) is in charge of keeping Bubble Bath Bay ship-shape! Under his steady command, each episode sees Sydney and Zip embarking on a new and exciting adventure, learning important lessons about teamwork, friendship, cooperation and problem solving."
