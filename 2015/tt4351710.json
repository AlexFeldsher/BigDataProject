        "plot outline": "When you're a young teenager, sometimes it can feel like your every embarrassing, mortifying, cringe-worthy moment is being watched by everyone. And in Toby Martin's (Grayson Maxwell Gurnsey) case - it is. Toby's your average 13-year-old 7th grader. He's dealing with growing pains, zits, a changing voice, an annoying younger sister, some mild social awkwardness and a burgeoning, intense interest in girls. Added to this, Toby's life - unbeknown to him - has become The Game. His attempts to get through the day without too many disasters are followed by two sportscasters, Bob (Jonathan Torrens) and Geri (Samantha Bee), who give play-by-play, analysis and color commentary of Toby's every move for viewers at home. They cheer for him when he wins and feel defeated when he loses, but are always in admiration of how Toby tries to triumph in each mortifying challenge that life throws his way.",
