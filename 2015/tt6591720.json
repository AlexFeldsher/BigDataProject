The Cape, however, turns out to be a cruel mountain mistress. After three months in their new home they still haven't made any friends and to make matters worse, they lose everything they own when their house is burgled while they're out camping for a long weekend. This kicks off a chain of events that introduces them to their local neighborhood watch- a motley mob of misfits who use the excuse of neighborhood safety to patrol the streets at night looking for whatever excitement the suburbs have to offer. Set against the backdrop of post-recession South Africa, Die Buurtwag is the story of strangers becoming a community, and with a society that seems to be getting stranger by the day, learning that survival is a team sport and that places aren't safe, but people just might be.",
