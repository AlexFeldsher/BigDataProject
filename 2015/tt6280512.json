Zhou's mom complains that her daughter is still single, therefore You gives his sachet with \"Blossom Luck\" to Zhou, but Zhou is not appreciated. Since then, Zhou and You have become involved in each other's life. You's ex-wife Shen Ya learns from local newspaper that You wins a lottery, and asks him to pay a debt of 100 thousand yuan. However, it is only a misunderstanding. You doesn't win the lottery, so he has to raise money in order to get rid of Shen. Zhou has a relationship with Lu Yaowei for five years, but Lu never plans to settle down and get married. Zhou breaks up with him, and asks You to pretend to be her boyfriend, so that her mother will not worry about her marriage. Once, she gets hurt accidentally and You looks after her carefully. Zhou's mom turns You down at first, but she is moved by You's carefulness and patience in the end. Zhou's mom decides to help You and encourages him to express his love to Zhou boldly. At this time, Zhou finds out that her close friend Zhong Ti avenges on her ex-boyfriend Lu, costing Lu his job. Zhou doesn't appreciate Zhong's behavior. So they end up in quarrels. Zhou tells his mom frankly that she and You don't establish a love relationship impulsively but pretend to be lovers for the whole time. However, she already has feelings for him after getting along with him and she doesn't know what to do. Her mom suggests that she should consider it circumspectly. Zhong, however, tries to persuade You and Zhou to break up, because she thinks that whom Zhou really loves is Lu and he is the one that can make her happy. In order to offer Zhou a wonderful life, You breaks up with Zhou unwillingly. After Zhong knows that Zhou is single again, she encourages Lu to reunite with Zhou, but Zhong already forms an attachment to Lu herself. You expresses his deep feelings to Zhou bravely after drinking. Zhou is deeply touched, and she finds herself fallen in love with this man, who is clumsy at speech but responsible in action. In the end, Zhou and You are together, and Zhong and Lu get married with blessings from Zhou.",
