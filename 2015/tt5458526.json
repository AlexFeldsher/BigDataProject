He has three days left to live. He would like to enjoy life one last time. He enters the magical Paris celebrating its new New Year's Day. But an anxiety is spreading: the fear of the Y2K bug, the fear that all the systems will stop and that time might not be taken into account any more. Most of all, every machines will reset... He dies at 3 a.m. on January 1st - but wakes up again on December 29th, 1999. Mathieu quickly realizes he is trapped inside a time loop.
