Hong Wangnan, the fiance of Wang Mutian's cousin was an engineer of KMT Air Force. He secretly sneaked into Shanghai to look for aircraft manufacturing talent and persuaded them to help the central aircraft manufacturing factory to manufacture fighters. At the same time, Sang Xia, Wang Mutian's cousin arrived in Shanghai Singapore. In fact, this Sang Xia was not the real one, but a Communist Party member, and she attempted to develop a channel for New Fourth Army to buy drugs and other materials from overseas. Under the guidance of Sang Xia, Wang Mutian grew into a staunch revolutionary fighter from an ignorant patriotic young man. During that time, those young people in Wang family and Hong family were going through all sorts of trials and tests, and finally embarked on different paths in life.",
