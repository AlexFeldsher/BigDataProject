            "The main backdrop to The Wild is a stretch of land that is home to a five-star game lodge, presenting the opportunity to make the best of the breathtaking beauty of the African wild.The story revolves around three families the Lebones, the van Reenens and the Tladis. Because of past conflicts, they struggle to negotiate a cohesive future, but the families are bound together because of their relationship to a special piece of land. This is also where you will find an exclusive lodge renowned for its fine dining under head chef Bernie Cupido (Faye Peters), expensive champagne, pampering sessions, game drives at sunset and private chalets. It attracts staff and guests who are up to all kinds of shenanigans."
