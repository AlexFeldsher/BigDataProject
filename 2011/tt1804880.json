            "As a Homicide Detective, Jessica King (Amy Price-Francis) sees things that everyone else misses: in crime scenes, in evidence, in the motivations and drives of the suspects. A fearless and imaginative lateral thinker, her unique eye for detail turns cases around. And she has a rare quality: Jess doesnt need to be liked. That quality gets her into trouble.Almost two years ago, the former Chief of Police sent Jess to the call centre - the Police Service equivalent of Siberia - for an act of gross insubordination. She went public about corruption on the Force. Some of her colleagues havent forgotten, let alone forgiven her. After the shuffle, Jess struggled to accept that the career part of things had run its course. She started thinking about something that shed avoided for a long time. Family. A new life.So, Jess dove into a third marriage with fellow officer and Guns and Gangs team member Detective Daniel Sless (Gabriel Hogan). Danny adores Jess. But their rigorous efforts to get pregnant havent panned out so far. And thats putting a strain on things.When Detective Sergeant Derek Spears (Alan Van Sprang) has a public, televised meltdown, Jessica King is called in to lead the Major Crimes Task Force (M.C.T.F.) a police squad that is parachuted in to take over cases in crisis. Murder, rape, robbery, gang violence, serial and predatory crime everythings fair game.The unit takes over cases already in progress and in crisis. A cop or the courts screw up, or another squad drops the ball and Jess and her team have to work fast, take big risks and probably piss some people off to get it back on track. Like Jess, the M.C.T.F. doesnt have many boundaries.Spears is less than gracious about the fact that King is now in charge of what was his unit. He was a good cop once, very good, and he will be again. But, itll take Jessica King to help him get his mojo back. There's chemistry between them and Jess will be tempted - Spears is a lot like the guys she swore off years ago. Besides, she's determined to make her marriage with Danny work. Colleagues may resent her but Kings fierce intelligence, passion for her job, disarming honesty and wicked sense of humour overrides their doubts. King is a lateral, imaginative thinker whose rare eye for detail gives her a critical edge. And, shes tough. King has survived eight years in Homicide, two marriages and multiple stab wounds. Off duty, King is a wife, a lover and a friend, who struggles with issues of infertility, intimacy and trust and like most women, she cant pass up a good shoe sale.From www.showcase.ca"
