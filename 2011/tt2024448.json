When these two friends finally meet, they decide to do something to change their dull lives in an unconventional way by setting out to become superheroes, despite lacking special powers, training or anything else that one might associate with being a superhero. With this new-found perspective on life and the feel-good idea of saving people, Kevin and Kate start running towards any trouble they can find. To their surprise, being a homemade hero isn't always easy, especially when it's time to use the training that you don't have.",
