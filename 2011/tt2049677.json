        "plot outline": "Backyard Games is an exciting reality competition series pitting real guys against one another in tests of backyard skill. Each episode of Backyard Games will be comprised of three exciting rounds. Round 1: The Speed Round Round 1 kicks off with a fast challenge, one designed to draw you in with action and maybe even some destruction. Round 2: The Finesse Round Now that we've grabbed the audience, Round 2 is a more contemplative challenge, one that will involve craft and finesse. At the end of Round 2 you'll find yourself respecting the power tool chops of the contestants. Round 3: The Backyard Gauntlet Round 3 is the main attraction, an obstacle course race that will involve three challenges that build to a big finish. Each leg of the race feeds into the next challenge. The pace is frantic, the activities are challenging and contestants must always be keeping an eye out for where their opponent is in the race. The winner is decided on who wins the overall race, so Round 3 is worth the most points and will crown our ultimate champion.",
