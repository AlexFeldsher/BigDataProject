            "Cars are about to be repossessed. The tow trucks and camera crews pull up to a house and snatch a car and raise it up. The hosts (varies by location, mostly in the south) knock on the door and tell the people their car is being repossessed. Cue angry responses, foul language, threats, weapons, etc. After calming them down, they are told they can save their car free and clear if they can answer three of five questions right on a trivia quiz. Questions are generally simple, but these folks can't even grasp what they are being asked. The majority don't seem to know the difference between a city and a state, or a country and a continent. If they get a question right, the car is a lowered a bit on the tow truck. Get it wrong and they raise it a bit. (Time killing dramatics) It's not a surprise that these cars are in repossession, I doubt the folks even understand the paperwork they signed when they bought the cars. Some are up for repossession for the second or third time and some houses have two cars up for repo. Great for laughs if you like watching ignorant people."
