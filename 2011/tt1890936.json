            "\"Eileen\" is loosely based on the story of Tanja Nijmeijer, the student who joined the FARC to fight for the poor and oppressed population at the bottom of Colombian society. Eileen grows up in Groningen in a harmonious family. She is a happy, socially engaged young woman who studies Spanish and is active in the squatting movement. She receives the opportunity to become an intern in Bogota, Colombia. Even though she stays in an decent environment, she is also exposed to the atrocious living conditions in the slums.\nOn her return to the Netherlands, Eileen has changed. She finds her friends from the squatting movement spoiled and egocentric. They have no interest for the really relevant, political problems, like the ones she was confronted with in Latin America. Against the wishes of her family she goes back to Colombia, because she finds she has to be there in order to do something about the injustice that prevails. In Bogota, she comes in contact with the FARC through a Colombian student she met in Groningen. She is tested and in the end conscripted into the resistance movement. Her initial enthusiasm and faith in the cause are put under pressure when she becomes involved in actions that are unacceptable in her opinion. However, slowly her values shift. She radicalizes and becomes on of the most dedicated fighters. She also turns into an international symbol of the FARC, an important weapon in the PR strategy of the guerrilla movement. But is this really what is looking for? And is her family just going to put up with it?"
