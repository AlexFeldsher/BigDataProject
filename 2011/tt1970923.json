            "SERIES SYNOPSISKenny Hotz from Testees & Kenny vs. Spenny, is finished with trivial tête-à-tête competitions and is ready to take on the world. Each episode finds Kenny stopping at nothing to fulfill a Herculean task and change society, as we know it. This Mission Impossible meets Dateline series will see Kenny attempting the insane and challenging socially acceptable boundaries in such missions as trying to build a mosque for Islam with Jewish money and trying to find a husband for his widowed mother. Although he is fueled by a personal and higher moral purpose, because this is Kenny Hotz, his tactics will always be unconventional and unpredictable.Coming off the widely successful Kenny vs. Spenny, Kenny Hotz wanted to move forward with creating a series that had more meaning for him. He came up with the idea to tackle newsworthy issues that would be both appealing and have meaning for audiences. Kenny vs. Spenny was a show about two friends trying to win a competition, says Hotz. There were some moralistic values in it so it did have some meaning but Kenny Hotzs Triumph Of The Will has real heart. This show means something its about the world, capitalism, religion, peace, love.\nTo help him move forward with the concept of the show, Kenny enlisted the help of friends and colleagues Jeff Kassel and Sebastian Cluer, who produce with Hotz. Kenny told us about an idea he had for a show that would tackle zeitgeisty ideas in a way that no one else was doing, recalls Kassel. Adds Cluer; Kenny has always been a seeker of the unusual. His love of throwing himself in the mix is the template for doing this show. Kenny just goes for it he throws himself into the fire and walks out holding the flames.\nDespite having a gorilla approach to the show, the team wanted a more sophisticated look. We put a lot of thought into lighting and mood because the cameras are solely on Kenny and his journey. We have to stay true to what hes doing but also create a story arch and make sure it flows, notes Cluer. We really wanted to create something that was instantly recognizable. I think all of the episodes have a very unique brand and look to them.EPISODE SYNOPSES101: Take My Mom...Please!\nLogline:Kenny tries to get his old, long widowed Mother laid.Synopsis:Kenny's mother has been a lonely widow for over twenty years and at the age of seventy-five, she is running out of time to find a man.
