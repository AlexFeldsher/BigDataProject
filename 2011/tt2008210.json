            "Francis Marcus Sonny Meadows and his new wife Myra Mae Hennessey Hart Meadows each, and in their own right, had very successful professional careers. Sonny, (never call him Francis), was the Go To Divorce Attorney representing only the elite, while Myra Mae was a very successful Real Estate Broker representing the crème de la crème of Houston. Though still pursuing only deep pocket clients (or so they think), they find themselves taking any client and listing, which very often puts them in bazaar and somewhat compromising situations.Their receptionist Jessica Meadows, who by the way is Sonnys niece, noticeably lacks in both efficiency and office etiquette, which helps Sonny and Myra Mae find themselves in those bazaar and somewhat compromising situations. Jacqueline Jac Hennessey (Myras ½ sister) is again ready for the next big pre-nup dismantling. Then there is Sydney Snoops Horn, proprietor of Snoops Detective Agency, who will follow and retrieve important and unimportant information on anyone and everyone anytime all the time.Sonny and Myra Mae had it all until well, guess youll just have to pull a Snoops and hide and watch!Francis Marcus Sonny Meadows - Chuck Houston; Myra Mae Hennessey Hart Meadows - Yankie Grant;\nJacqueline Jac Hennessey - Maria O. Sirgo; Sydney Snoops Horn - Melody Moss; Jessica Meadows -\tChrissy Hajovsky\n"
