            "A teenage boy named Paul is haunted by apocalyptic dreams that nobody can explain. As if that weren't terrifying enough, he begins to see spirits of the dead, known as _The Fades_ (qv), all around him. _The Fades_ (qv) can't be seen, smelt, heard or touched by other humans. When an embittered and vengeful Fade, Polus, finds a way to be human again, it's up to Paul to stop him - and all of the dead - from breaking back into the world and destroying the human race.::BBC Publicity"
