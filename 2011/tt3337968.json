        "plot outline": "String Theory is a new Science Fiction series of video shorts featuring the comical exploits of two scientists living on the small volcanic island of Aztlan, just off the coast of Mexico. The average running time of an episode is 12 minutes. The cartoon-like stories are presented in a campy low-tech, practical-effect, puppet show environment. The main characters are marionettes that interact with a bizarre variety of doomsday devices and exotic places. Their machines are created with a \"Steam Punk\" and 1950's \"Retro-Futurism\" design. The setting for this series takes place in 1957 up to the end of the world in 1960 and the sets are lavishly detailed and brightly colored scale models done up in period styling.",
