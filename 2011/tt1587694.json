            "This new series from ABC Studios is a medical drama that follows the lives of the people who put their lives into the running of a nonprofit hospital in the wilds of South America. In need of more doctors, the founding doctor, Dr. Ben Keeton (Martin Henderson), advertises for medical residents to finish out their residencies in his hospital, in hopes of inspiring at least one person to stay on. Out of hundreds of applicants, he picks three. Dr. Mina Minard (Mamie Gummer) is an urban doctor who misdiagnosed a patient which consequently led to his untimely death. Dr. Lily Brenner (Caroline Dhavernas) is an ER doctor who lost her boyfriend under her own scalpel. And Dr. Tommy Fuller (Zach Gilford) is a bright plastic surgeon who is satisfied with just getting by. Together, they form an unlikely bond as the new kids on the block. During the first season, we watch as Dr. Minard slowly lowers the walls she had erected around herself prior to arrival. Dr. Brenner discovers that she is still a competent doctor, and Dr. Fuller learns the importance of being earnest. But the real juice is in the stories that were playing out long before their arrival. Dr. Keeton has a deep dark secret and Dr. Otis Cole (Jason George) is a recovering addict. Emotions run deep as hope, love, and inspiration play out in the least likely of places!"
