Nobody is immune to cultural misunderstandings - especially not when it comes to our European neighbours. But is what we think and hear about them actually true? Of course not! Or at least not all of it. And that is precisely what \"POINTS OF YOU\" is all about. Here we take a closer look at some of these prejudices and clichés, turn them upside down and see what's really behind them! But How? Take plenty of students of various nationalities and put them in a student home in Berlin. Now spice this up with different languages and customs and observe the resulting chaotic daily life of them. Our special add-on: Every character has its own individual perspective and cinematic style. And you can even hear their thoughts! Our pilot episode \"Tuna and the Mafia\" focuses on these four characters: BASTIAN (Germany): A somewhat neurotic computer science student with a soft spot for his pot plant Flora and a penchant for romance. ÉLODIE (France): A flirtatious environmental activist and the main reason for Bastian's romantic feelings. RYAN (England): Islander, drama graduate and self-proclaimed womanizer, hobby chef and party king. SOFIA (Italy...more specifically: Sicily): 1. Not in the Mafia. 2. Still not in the Mafia! And 3.
