        "plot outline": "Cattle Country is a modern-day, western reality series. It is situated in the Nebraska Sandhills where all 800 of the county's population is directly affected by the cattle industry. The stories follow three interdependent, real-life families who ranch, farm, and run a feed lot respectively: the Caulfield's, who raise cattle on grass, the Heerten's who grow field corn to fatten the cattle, and the Ferguson's who own a feed lot where the cattle are fattened. The series is four faceted. From one view, it is simply an action-adventure show where the viewer can vicariously be a cowboy and play with big boy toys each week. From another view, it is a heart-warming family value's show, providing positive role models of spouses, parents, and children working and playing outdoors. Twist the view again, and it educates about the inner nuts-and-bolts workings of a diminishing agricultural society. And finally, the series tackles controversial legislative policies or politically correct views which have unintended negative consequences on Americans' food production. Cattle Country is comprised from the 2% of America's population which has been endowed stewardship of America's eco-system, and demonstrates the reverence with which they hold it. Cattle Country is America's grass roots.",
