Starring Finkleman and Lauren Lee Smith (CSI; The L Word), the sharply ironic series focuses on the life of George, a self-absorbed, neurotic TV producer. After hooking up with Claire, a gorgeous model half his age, George negotiates his new reality dating a younger woman by pitching a reality show about his high concept, highly coveted, seriously volatile life. But when network executives insist that Claire move into his house, George is forced to escalate the relationship and consequently, his fears of commitment. When the pitch and his life go sideways, he frets, vents and reevaluates by soliciting questionable advice from his best friend Doug (Jason Weinberg). Finkleman is renowned as the writer, creator and producer of the CBC/PBS series The Newsroom, a biting satire that mined the darkly humorous world of broadcast news. The series also aired on Sky in the UK and other networks worldwide, and was awarded with an International Emmy for Best Comedy Series in 2005. Finkleman also produced Married Life (Comedy Central, Atlantis Films) and Foolish Heart, Foreign Objects, More Tears and At The Hotel for the CBC, and wrote screenplays for a number of Hollywood films in the 1980s, including Airplane II.",
