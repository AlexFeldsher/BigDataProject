        "plot outline": "At the end of the Ottoman period, there was a man called Al Qasem Al Ahmad. He was the leader of the resistance against the Ottoman State in Nablus in Palestine. However the Ottomans decided to eliminate all who opposed their great oppression in Nablus, which led our man Al Qasem to seek the Sheikh of the Kerak castle, Ibrahim Al Domour, for refuge. Mohammad Ali knew about Qasem Al Ahmad's being in Kerak so he deputized his son Ibrahim Pasha who was known for his brutal control of the army. He ordered the army to march toward Kerak and asked for Al Ahmad to be handed over but the city refused to do so and gathered around their Sheikh and his guest instead shouting, \"Death and no submission\". They were all armed with faith, patience and courage within the castle. Ibrahim Al Domour had three children, the oldest of whom was called Al Sayyed. One day, when his two sons Al Sayyed and Ali went out to inspect the daily life of their citizens, they were caught by the Ottomans. This put them in a stronger position to force the people of Kerak to surrender Al Qasem to them as the Sheikh's two sons are now in their possession. The Ottomans threatened the Sheikh to burn his two sons and the whole city unless he handed them over Al Qasem, which put him in a dilemma: shall he choose his sons and give up on one of the most important Arab traditions, which is give refuge to whoever who seeks it from them? Here arises the heroic role of his wife Alya who said, \"One's children can be compensated but one's homeland can never be replaced\". She advised her husband to sacrifice their children for the sake of their homeland.",
