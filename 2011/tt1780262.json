He has come back as a zombie in servitude to the cute necromancer who brought him back. Then one night, as Ayumu was spending time in the graveyard a mysterious girl with a chainsaw sliced him in half. Instead of dying (again), Ayumu became the world's first magical girl zombie.::Paul Magne Haakonsen"
