            "The hit of its broadcast season, _Kuzey Güney_ (qv) is based on a fantastic script with universal themes. It is a compelling family drama about the rivalry between two bothers which has been sold as a ready made and scripted format in multiple territories around the world. Kuzey and Güney are brothers with very different characters. But they have two things in common: they are both ambitious to escape a life working in the family business - a life that their father wants for them-and they are both in love with the same girl from their neighbourhood: Cemre. The choices three young people make to find happiness in an unforgiving world will change the lives of all around them for ever.::ahmetkozan"
