            "CHAOS is a comedic drama about a group of rogue CIA spies in the Office of Disruptive Services (ODS), who combat threats to national security amidst bureaucratic gridlock, rampant incompetence and political infighting. With outdated technology and limited supplies, the ODS team tackles high-risk foreign intelligence missions using manipulation, deception and wit to succeed. Rick Martinez was dismayed when his dream job as a spy was eliminated due to budget cuts on his first day; however, CIA Deputy Director H.J. Higgins, a calculating mastermind and head of the Clandestine Administration and Oversight Services (CHAOS), recognizes an opportunity and manipulates Rick into being his mole inside the secretive ODS department. Martinez joins the team under Michael Dorset, a psychologist-turned-CIA operative and a tactical genius motivated by pure paranoia. Working with Martinez is Scottish-born Billy Collins, de-commissioned from the British Secret Service and deported from the United Kingdom; and Casey Malick, a 12-year veteran of the agency with an understated demeanor and the ability to transform into a \"human weapon.\" While Martinez's instincts about who he can believe are constantly tested, he may have found a confidante in officer Fay Carson, an alluring agent and an expert at deciphering people's \"tells.\" Attacking each assignment with unparalleled confidence and gusto, these ODS operatives perform covert operations, exert political influence and eradicate all manner of evil-and that's just to survive the morning staff meeting."
