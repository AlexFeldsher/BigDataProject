        "plot outline": "Jang Jae Hun is a high school dropout who roams the streets at night with his two best friends pick-pocketing drunkards. He accidentally causes an accident that leads to the death of a stranger. Park Tae Yi lives in the countryside with her grandfather, and inherited her musical talents from her father. Ha Do Sung composes songs in anonymity as rock star HADES. Having been abandoned at a young age by his ambitious mother, he tries to live quietly without drawing attention to himself. Kim Byeong Gun is the odd one out in his family of businessmen, wishing to pursue a career in musicals - despite his debilitating fear of performing in front of others. Eun Chae Young is the experienced actress, having been in the industry for 10 years. However, she has the desire to prove herself on the musical stage, rather than a movie actress with a pretty face. What she doesn't expect is to be challenged by Oh Doo Ri, an equally talented actress who prefers to spend her time playing first-person shooting computer games than rehearsing. These young adults end up together in the musical department of Haneul Arts University, and find themselves under the guidance of unconventional professor Sunwoo Young. With each passing day, they get a chance to learn what it is to be a 'star,' and to prove to the people around them that they can succeed in their chosen path.",
