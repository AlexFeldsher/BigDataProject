Third daughter Sakurako works at a wig factory and is on the lookout for a marriage minded man. She's easily swayed by others. Youngest daughter Ume is a 2nd year theater student at an art college.

            "Daigo Hanawa is a father who is popular with the ladies. He's married to Sachiko Hanawa, a girlish mom who loves her husband unconditionally. They have four daughters and, unlike their father, all have zero luck with the opposite sex. Eldest daughter Fujiko is a single career woman who works at a fashion magazine and is highly competitive. Second daughter Takemi is the black sheep of the family. She has been divorced two times and has three children. Third daughter Sakurako works at a wig factory and is on the lookout for a marriage minded man. She's easily swayed by others. Youngest daughter Ume is a 2nd year theater student at an art college. She is a late bloomer and has had no experience with falling in love."
