Annabel is joined in her stylish loft apartment by Jimmy, her often unpredictable intern from the South Pole, a calamity - prone, fish-mad penguin who's made his home in her fridge and Pearl, Annabel's right hand penguin who organises the website and deals with ordering ingredients and finding the perfect perfect recipe to suit every occasion. Watching over everything and providing a singing commentary on kitchen activities,are Candice, Dionne and Lola - three of the most pampered, vain and ditsy princess cupcakes in the land. Finally, there are Jimmy's marvellous mechanical aids that he's made for Annabel. There's every cooks dream, the Fruit 'n' Vegetabilizer, which slices, dices, chops or squeezes any fruit or vegetable into whatever shape you'd like. The Cookatron is a cunning oven where food is cooked to perfection in seconds. And finally, the ultimate food critic, the Yummy Scrummy-o-meter, which sniffs food for deliciousness. Each week, the children come and hang out with Annabel in her loft apartment and Annabel, Jimmy, Pearl and a host of hilarious guest characters help the children overcome a different food related problem in an entertaining way. The kids watch and learn as Annabel does what she loves best- inspiring children to make their favourite meals and try something new.",
