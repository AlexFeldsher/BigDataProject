He tells Gauri that he always wanted his son, Siddhant (Swapnil Joshi) to marry her. He tells Gauri that Siddhant is obsessed with earning money and does not care much for relationships. He asks Gauri to try and make Siddhant realize the importance of relationship. Gauri and Siddhant go to their honeymoon hotel. Siddhant is welcomed by the hotel's manager, Sachin. Gauri comes there and introduces herself to Sachin. Sachin realizes that he has mistaken Siddhant as a rich industrialist, Akhilesh Shastri. Sachin changes his tone. Gauri treats the hotel bell boy as her brother and Siddhant is shocked. Gauri makes Siddhant understand that the bell boy is human too. Siddhant tells her that if she talks sweetly to such people, they will swindle her. Siddhant blames Gauri of not knowing how to behave with people. Siddhant tells her that he will be working on a project. Gauri tries to tell him that they have come to celebrate their honeymoon. Siddhant wants to impress Akhilesh who will be staying at their hotel. Gauri's aunt, Manda, comes to meet her in the hotel room. Siddhant is bugged by Gauri's aunt and her boisterous ways. Later, Siddhant gets his project ready and finds Akhilesh in the hotel lobby. He has a fight with a man in the lobby over a trivial issue. Siddhant tells Akhilesh that he has a proposal that he wants to show him. Akhilesh tells Siddhant that he should take an appointment with his PA. The PA is the same man with whom he had fought. Siddhant screams at Gauri when he goes back to his room. Gauri asks him what is wrong. Siddhant tells him about Akhilesh and his PA whom he had fought with. Gauri assures him that he will definitely get his appointment. Gauri takes Siddhant to the laundry room and Siddhant speaks rudely with the bell boy. Gauri speaks sweetly to the bell boy and asks him to help them. The bell boy tells Gauri that he has found about the PA and his habits. He tells his idea of getting Siddhant's name in the PA's diary. He says how he will write Siddhant's name in the diary. The bell boy tells Siddhant that he is not doing it for money but for the love shown by Gauri to them. Siddhant is skeptical but is overjoyed when he gets the appointment. Siddhant asks Gauri to accompany him to the meeting. Akhilesh comes to have lunch with Siddhant and Gauri. Akhilesh's PA is shocked to see Siddhant. Siddhant is nervous and cannot speak well with Akhilesh. Akhilesh asks him to relax and speak about the proposal. Gauri speaks to Akhilesh praising Siddhant's hard work. Fortunately, Akhilesh turns out to belong to the part of the state where Gauri hails from. Akhilesh praises Gauri and congratulates Siddhant for having such a loving wife. Akhilesh agrees to work on the proposal and asks Siddhant to go with him to New Zealand. Akhilesh asks Siddhant to send Gauri home. Siddhant watches the way Gauri gets ready to send Siddhant to New Zealand. Gauri even packs Siddhant's bag. Siddhant calls Akhilesh and tells him that he cannot go to New Zealand with him. Gauri wonders why Siddhant did so. He replies that he is in love with his wife who has taught him that relationships are more important than money.",
