        "plot outline": "It is in the middle of 1980s. Old grudge is deep-rooted between two neighbors the Ma's and the Liang's. Liang Zi, who went to prison ten years ago as an alleged rapist, is recently released from the prison. Even though Liang Zi went to prison for raping Wang Yan, Wang Yan and her husband Ma Ming always help Liang Zi whenever they can, which is really strange to Ma Ming's mother. Under the interrogation of Ma Ming's mother, Wang Yan tells the truth about Liang Zi: 10 years ago, Wang Yan nearly committed suicide. At that time, she was carrying Ma Ming's baby as an unmarried mom while he was under the investigation. Out of a deep love for Wang Yan, Liang Zi claimed he raped Wang Yan so that both Wang Yan and Ma Ming could be protected. However, Liang Zi's sacrifice does not give Wang Yan a happy life. Faced with her husband's suspicion and her mother-in-law's criticism, Wang Yan is mentally and physically exhausted. At this time, Ma Ming is faced with financial charges. Liang Zi and Wang Yan exert great effort to save him from going to prison. Touched by Liang Zi, Ma Ming decides to step out so that Liang Zi and Wang Yan can be together. However, Ma Ming's sister Ma Juan also has a huge crush on Liang Zi, and wants to elope with him. When Liang Zi's mother is dying, she tells the truth that Liang Zi is the abandoned child of Ma Ming's mother in her early years. When all the secrets are exposed, Liang Zi chooses to leave Wang Yan with Ma Ming and disappear from their lives.",
