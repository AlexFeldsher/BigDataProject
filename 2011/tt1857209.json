        "plot outline": "It all starts in 2010, when ring leader Tony Roucas, a.k.a. Mad Tony, who is serving a long-term prison sentence, and Kenz a young North African delinquent from an estate, escape from prison. In this 21st century overcrowded prison, they share the same tiny cell. They have absolutely nothing in common and have nothing to say to each other. Their escape reveals their differences even more, where the old methods of organized crime (with carefully planned missions, codes and complex networks) conflict with the new ones (fast, immediate, less prepared). Tony faces his past and exposes the cops and crooks who sent him to jail. Several flashbacks take us back to his hectic past, from the 50s up to the 80s including the events of 1968 and paint a vivid picture of the history of organized crime.",
