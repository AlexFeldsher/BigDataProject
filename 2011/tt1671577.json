From 1950 to 1970, three lead characters are seen as groundbreaking away from this stereotype (despite two being wife and mother): Lucy Ricardo in I Love Lucy (1951), Laura Petrie in The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961) and Mary Richards in Mary Tyler Moore (1970), who were each independent for different reasons,...

The shows of Norman Lear, most specifically _\"All in the Family\" (1968)_, broke open that mold, where the men were shown as being independent thinkers often regardless of the needs of the family. By the mid 1980's, these two trends melded with The Cosby Show (1984), where Cliff ...    "

            "This documentary series looks at the evolution of specific character types appearing on American primetime episodic television from post WWII to the early twenty-first century. These characters were often a reflection of the times and often shaped by world events such as WWII, the Vietnam War and 9/11, but some also influenced behavior and attitudes, especially of such characterizations in future television shows. Landmark characterizations are presented and the reasons for them being landmarks are discussed.::Huggo",
            "Each episode of _America in Primetime_ (qv) focuses on one character archetype that has remained a staple of primetime through the generations - the Man of the House, the Independent Woman, the Misfit, and the Crusader - capturing both the continuity of the character, and the evolution. MAN OF THE HOUSE- In 1950s television, the man of the house was king of his castle, but then he began losing control. Was it all an illusion to begin with? INDEPENDENT WOMAN- Far removed from the model housewife of yesterday, women today on TV care less about pleasing others and more about being true to themselves. THE MISFIT -Whether they are oddballs, losers or just plain weird, misfits have grown beyond comic stereotypes and are taking center stage with a vengeance, refusing to apologize for who they are. THE CRUSADER- Heroes today are complex. Their stories are told with increasing humanity, depicting characters who confront almost impossible choices as they fight evil in a world where the line between right and wrong is often blurred.::The Documentary Group",
