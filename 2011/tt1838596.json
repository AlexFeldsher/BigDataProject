            "Tyler Hanson and his larger than life alter-ego, Carol Ann McCracken, struggle with new found success hosting a do-it-yourself television show. But balancing his broken marriage, over-bearing mother, detached son, soon-to-be ex-boyfriends, and the frantic team of misfits who seem determined to kill him for ratings gold, might be a recipe for disaster when you do it all wearing six inch heels. Mix one part Tootsie with two parts 30 Rock, add a dash of Home Improvement. Stir briskly until Ugly Betty'd.::Anonymous"
