It follows six Uniform Patrol Division officers through their professional and personal lives. At the same time, it reveals the world of the gangs,it's leaders and it's soldiers as they pursue their own dreams of love and power. The streets of the 2nd District are where those two worlds become interlaced. The story follows the lives of two of the main characters, Darrien Cruz, a patrolman, and Phillippe \"Sin\" Cortez , who is the leader of a powerful gang responsible for most of the shootings and drug trafficking in Hartford. Cruz, who wants to become a narcotics detective, and Sin, a disillusioned career criminal, cross paths. Sin sees an opportunity in becoming an informant for Cruz. He will work for Cruz and Cruz alone. Together, they begin solving homicides and major drug offenses. To do this, Sin must betray the only family he has ever known. Through Cruz and Sin we see the politics, the back stabbing, the honor and betrayal, the kindness and violence, the hate and the love that runs through each man's world. The sameness hidden in the differences of the 2nd District.",
