Throughout his 46-year reign, his fame as the greatest warrior and ruler of his age spreads both to the East and West. With his companion Pargali Ibrahim, Süleyman achieves great victories, and makes his name known in the Muslim World. Süleyman called Ibrahim his brother, friend and advisor. The television series shows Süleyman's consolidation of his power: Pargali Ibrahim being grand minister of state, reinforcing the rule of law throughout the empire, meeting foreign diplomats, and preparing for military campaigns, all set against the backdrop of the tension between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The series also focuses on the relationships among the members of the imperial household, especially romantic entanglements and rivalries. The animosity between Hürrem Sultan and Mahidevran Sultan, mother of the Sultan's eldest son, and the role of Hafsa Sultan, the valide sultan; Hürrem's rise as Süleyman's favorite while pregnant with his son, her falling from favor several times and her eventual return to grace; Pargali Ibrahim's entanglement with Hatice Sultan, the Sultan's sister, and many others.",
