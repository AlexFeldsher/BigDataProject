Na Ra plays Lee So Young, a 34-year-old woman who looks ten years younger than she is, and manages to fool everyone about her age. So Young also has a large family debt to take care of. With only a high school education and big dreams of being a fashion designer, she has her work cut out for her. The only thing she has going for her in the cutthroat fashion world is her youthful appearance. In a fortunate accident, she gets mistaken for her younger sister Lee So Jin for a modeling job and manages to land a job at her dream fashion company. There, she meets one of the managing directors, Choi Jin Wook, who looks far older than he really is. The two of them clash, especially since Jin Wook treats So Young with disrespect, as if she is younger than he is-though she's actually his senior! See if age really does matter in this tale of love and fashion that will make you smile no matter how old you are.",
