The murder virtually explodes throughout the media and soon, no one and nothing is sacred. Rosie was drowned, her body was found locked in the trunk of a vehicle registered to the Richmond campaign. The scenes are rainy and grey but frequently, the jewel that is Seattle glitters through the precipitation. The worst aspects of humanity: insularity, intolerance, greed, intransigence and the inability to admit imperfection are placed on painful display as the investigation into Rosie's murder snowballs. Relationships are either forged in steel or else stretched beyond capacity as secrets are revealed. Through the tireless work of very unlikely partners, Detectives Sarah Linden and Stephen Holder, several painful situations have closure.::LA-Lawyer"
