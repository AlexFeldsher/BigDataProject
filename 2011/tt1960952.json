            "The Electric Barbarellas follows a five-piece electronic pop group trying to successfully break into the music business. After a four-year search that has exhausted her life savings, Heather Naylor recruits wild Missy Marie, model Raven Elise, comedian Gynger Fluellen, and girl-next-door type Chelsea Costa to join her band. Now living together, they record music, promote themselves, and play venues in order to develop a following and make their mark. But while Heather, with the help of assistant Roxann, struggles to find industry insiders willing to help the group get to the next level of their careers, she also discovers that the other women aren't always as willing as she is to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve stardom.\n"
