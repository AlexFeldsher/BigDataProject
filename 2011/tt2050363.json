The stories revolve around the five underlings - Lu, the prima donna lead actress; Fex, the nerdy editor/visual effects guru; Milly, the demure sound recordist; Ed, the sarcastic camera operator/grip; and Wilton, the brown-nosing gopher. In their endless struggles to appease the constantly-shifting, often illogical whims of Gustaf, their fascist director, they find themselves drifting in and out of tangential fantasies, intertextual parodies and parallel universes... all in the name of independent filmmaking. _The Void_ (qv) was conceived in early 2011 by creators Rita Artmann and Joe Bauer, who also star as Lu and Fex, respectively. _The Void_ (qv) also stars Emily Curtin as Milly, Isaac Moody as Wilton, Lawrence Silver as Ed and Rob Jenkins as the evil Gustaf.::Joe Bauer"
