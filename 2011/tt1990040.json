            "Following the successful first season, HBO Europe's 35-part drama TERAPIE II. (IN TREATMENT II.) brings a new batch of stories featuring therapist Marek Posta (Karel Roden) and his patients. The series deals with troubled relationships, sinister disorders in parent-child relationships, traumas caused challenging jobs and vexing inter-generation misunderstandings. It reveals connections to mysterious corners of human characters, sore subconscious mind, burdensome past, fear of future, personal prejudice and social conflicts. Mark's sessions with his clients suggest some possibilities for solving these conflicts, with self-understanding being the basic precondition. The show's second series is interpreted by a different cast. Of the original cast, two remain: Karel Roden as the controversial therapist and Kamila Magalova as his mentor Dita whom Marek confides in every Friday and who now speaks Slovak. The patients are new and include Tereza Brodska as the energetic lawyer Tana, whom Marek seeks out in the opening episode because of a possible police investigation of his person. Katerina Winterova and David Svehlik play the Neumanns, who are trying to resolve their marital issues and conflicts with their eleven-year-old son Viktor (Zdenek Barinka). Another of Marek's clients, who sees Marek on Wednesdays, is the traumatized architecture student Viola, interpreted by Tereza Voriskova. The former dissident Charvat, now the owner of a construction company, sees Marek on Thursdays and tries to resolve his problems with his adult daughter Katerina (Pavla Beretova). This overbearing skeptic who gets tangled up in suspect contracts is played by Jiri Ornest.::HBO Europe"
