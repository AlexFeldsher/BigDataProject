It is believed to be a kidnap for ransom, but the kidnapper does not demand one and instead says, \"If you want to pay money, you decide on the amount.\" Not knowing the kidnapper's objective, the police are at his mercy. Furthermore, to make a mockery of the police, the delivery of the ransom is arranged at the \"scramble\" crossing at Shibuya in the daytime. One would have thought that this unprecedented case would probably move toward resolution with the safety of the hostage. However, that is nothing more than a prologue to the case. There is a 700 million yen kidnap for ransom case behind it, and this is the last case that will unlock all the mysteries. Can Detective Hashiba (Tanabe Seiichi), an expert in kidnappings, corner the beautiful criminal named Ran (Dan Rei)?",
