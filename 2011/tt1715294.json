But when he discovers his girlfriend in bed with his best friend, he seizes a second chance to follow his dream - playing professional golf. With the help of his grizzled former mentor and coach, O'Riley, a once great golfer now one step away from suburban gigolo, and his sponsor, Charlie Chase, fresh from a money laundering scandal, Will is on his way to the pros. But playing with the big boys means navigating the ruthless world of tournament golf, where competitive rivals, corrupt sponsors and personal demons are all waiting to test the limits of Will's skill and perseverance on the green - and his cheating ex-girlfriend and potential new girlfriend are there to test him. Ultimately, the real challenge comes from within himself as he must transcend the drama of his life to find glory in the game.",
