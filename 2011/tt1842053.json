            "Journey to places forgotten by time - eerie locations that once hummed with activity and now are desolate. What happens when humans abandon a place? Across our planet, abandoned cities and apocalyptic dead zones, hide in plain sight. Boomtowns where the boom went bust. Industrial powerhouses, deserted and decaying. Once prosperous cities, now too toxic for human life. This is a glimpse of what the future might hold for the places each of us call home. These cities are chilling proof that there are no safe havens in our turbulent world. Cities created out of nothing, then abandoned or disregarded by the very industries that gave them birth. Stories of corporate profit and human loss. A startling glimpse into a possible future on our \"Forgotten Planet.\""
