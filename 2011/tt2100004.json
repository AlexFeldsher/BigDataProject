From Ben Franklin to the Wright brothers, from Thomas Edison to Steve Jobs, the United States has been a constant generator of revolutionary ideas. To this day, in basements and backyards around the country, Americans are striving to turn their dreams into the next big thing.Invention USA follows Reichart Von Wolfsheild and Garrett Lisi, both innovators and scientists with ties to investors, as they go in search of the next breakthrough invention. Whether they're traveling the country to visit garage innovators at home or meeting with inventors at their Los Angeles testing lab, Reichart and Garrett will put prototypes to the test and give a tough, no-nonsense evaluation of each invention's potential. If they like what they see, they'll invest to help bring the product to market. The stakes are high and dreams are on the line: Every idea has the potential to change someone's life... or even the world."
