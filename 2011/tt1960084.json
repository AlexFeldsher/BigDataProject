        "plot outline": "Since the death of her ex-husband Andy Smith over a year ago, Brooke Darst wants nothing more than to find happiness again. Brooke and Andy met back in high school aboard a cruise ship and from the moment they saw each other, it was love at first sight. Only Andy wasn't the only guy who had eyes for Brooke. Andy's best friend, Jason Anderson also liked her; but when he saw the chemistry between them, he backed off and in turn fell in love with her best friend Shannon Dobson. After graduating, both couples were set to get married. Brooke married Andy; however the marriage was annulled 6 months later when she discovered that he had a drinking problem. As for Jason and Shannon, their wedding was stopped when he realized that she had feelings for an old flame named James Andrews. After walking away, Jason moved on with his life and pursued a relationship with Brooke while Shannon married James and had two children together; three year old twins TJ and Tiffany. Now that he has a second chance at love, Jason plans to spend the rest of his life with Brooke; so he decides to ask for her hand in marriage. However when Brooke says she needs more time to think about, Jason starts to wonder if she's really over Andy and tries everything in his power to help her move on. Little do they know trouble is back in town and his name is Brian Douglas; a guy who used to date Brooke after she broke up with Andy. Once she discovers he's back in town, Brooke finds herself in love with two men once again. As for her friendship with Shannon, nothing could ruin it until she finds out about the proposal. Even though she married James, she never got over losing Jason. Now, not only does Shannon have to hide her anger and resentment towards Brooke; she also has to hide her ongoing love for Jason. Hoping that no one finds out, including James; will Shannon keep her feelings a secret any longer? Lastly, Shannon's little sister Amber and her boyfriend Jesse Thomas have been together since the eighth grade. But after visiting Shannon at college and meeting Evan Richards, Amber starts to doubt her feelings for Jesse; especially now as their last year of high school approaches. With the help and advice of her two best friends, Amber struggles whether to follow her heart and be with Evan, or stay with Jesse and finish school together as a couple.",
