        "synopsis": [
            "Emily Thorne (Emily Van Camp) is the newest arrival in the Hamptons. By all appearances, she's a friendly and sophisticated \"girl next door,\" but with a dark family history, Emily is anything but what she seems. Seventeen years ago, her father was framed for a crime by neighbors he trusted, and sentenced to life. Emily never saw her father again, and spent her childhood consumed by rage, loss and betrayal. Now she's returning under an assumed identity with one goal - REVENGE -- every social overture a carefully planned chip at the foundation of her sworn enemies. Victoria Grayson (Madeleine Stowe) is the glamorous matriarch of the Grayson family and reigning Queen of the Hamptons who holds a dark secret -- her culpability in the events that destroyed Emily's life. Conrad Grayson (Henry Czerny) is the head of the Grayson family, a man willing to do whatever it takes to slither out of scandalous situations. Daniel Grayson (Josh Bowman) is the Graysons' son who finds himself unable to resist Emily. Charlotte Grayson (Christa B. Allen), their daughter, fits right in with the \"mean girls\" of the Hamptons, but is also drawn to boys from the \"wrong side of the tracks.\" Nolan Ross (Gabrielle Mann) shares a link to Emily's past, her present and her secret. Jack Porter (Nick Wechsler) has spent his life helping his father manage the Stowaway Tavern, and when fate brings Emily into his life, he's unable to shake a deja vu-like connection to her. Declan Porter (Connor Paolo), Jack's kid brother, is intrigued by the wealthy world of these elite vacationers and finds a target in Charlotte Grayson. Emily's closest friend, Ashley Davenport (Ashley Madekwe), is the go-to event planner who hopes to gain entry into Victoria's good graces and solidify her status among the Hamptonites.OFFICIAL SYNOPSIS"
