This vast research effort, compiled moreover in four volumes, tells the story of a profound historic and cultural relationship: one that brings together Spain, Mexico, and Peru as three nations that formed part of the great Spanish Empire. Thus, visual works were exhibited with an aesthetic language that manifests the bonds of identity between these countries, as well as the details that distinguish their artistic production from the 16th to 18th centuries. This program bears witness to said exhibition and Fomento Cultural Banamex's genuine interest in the development of Mexican culture.",
