            "Zak Bagans hosts a competition between matched teams of amateur paranormal investigators at a different hot spot each week. The haunted site is divided into two separate zones, so that the teams do not overlap. Each group is given the same numbers and pieces of equipment to use. A countdown clock gives each team exactly two hours (under close audio and video surveillance at the command center) to investigate before the two teams switch zones. Dave Schrader (the host of Darkness Radio) is a permanent judge who provides balance between the show's two guest judges, all of whom watch the investigation with Zak from the command center. At the switching point, the paranormal investigators are given some feedback before being sent to the other location. The countdown clock is restarted so each group has the exact same time to gather evidence in all locations. The teams are then brought before the judging panel and told how they performed in terms of teamwork, use of history, and equipment. Each team is invited to present their best two pieces of audio and video evidence. Zak and the judges then decide which team has won that week's paranormal challenge and notify the winner.::Pam"
