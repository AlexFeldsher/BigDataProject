The four Prófugos - Vicente Ferragut, Alvaro \"Tegui\" Parraguez, Oscar Salamanca and Mario Moreno - are contracted by Kika Ferragut to ground transport a liquid cocaine shipment from the border of Bolivia to the Chilean port of Iquique. A complex web of ambitions, interests and corruption envelops this drama, where no one is what they seem, where everyone hides a past and where human wretchedness unites an unlikely foursome before the critical need to escape.",

            "Four men become fugitives after a failed drug deal, running from north to south of Chile.::Anonymous",
            "Prófugos (fugitives) is the story of a failed drug trafficking operation that sparks a full-out pursuit of four men who find themselves forced to find refuge throughout Chilean territory, as they flee from both the mafia and the law. The four Prófugos - Vicente Ferragut, Alvaro \"Tegui\" Parraguez, Oscar Salamanca and Mario Moreno - are contracted by Kika Ferragut to ground transport a liquid cocaine shipment from the border of Bolivia to the Chilean port of Iquique. A complex web of ambitions, interests and corruption envelops this drama, where no one is what they seem, where everyone hides a past and where human wretchedness unites an unlikely foursome before the critical need to escape.::HBO Latin America"
