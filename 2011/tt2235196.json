He's broke with nothing lined up. He retreats to the only place that gives him peace, the kitchen. But as much joy as he gets from cooking, he is blind to the fact that this could be his salvation and he lacks the confidence and self-worth to believe in himself in an area that breaches the walls of his comfort zone: sex. Something that seems so clear will never see the light until you can awaken from your own inner darkness. So Ryan falls back into what he knows, porn.
