Dealing with different folkloric tales of horror from the Egyptian culture, the series is both innovative and relevant to the target audience. The story revolves around Adam Yassin (played by Amr Waked), who is a clairvoyant journalist that writes about unsolved mysteries with details that are only known to him and the people he writes about. He has a gift that enables him to contact another realm to find out things about these unsolved cases. This gift, however, plagues him in his personal life as he struggles with his visions and his reality. Abwab El Khof tackles a lot of folkloric issues in the Egyptian society and opened a lot of doors that left them and didn't give final answers. The last episode Adam Yassin was fired of his job and the editor in chief called anonymous to tell them that he fired him. Adam found a secret hidden door in his grandfather's room and opened the door and the episode finished without knowing what he discovered inside. A lot of doors and questions needs to be revealed",
