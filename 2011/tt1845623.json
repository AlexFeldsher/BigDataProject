            "Armed With Only Basic Supplies, Nine Strangers Must Traverse 70+ Brutal Miles of Uncharted Terrain Back to Civilization.Nine ordinary people volunteered to participate in one of the world's most intense tests of will in the hit series OUT OF THE WILD: VENEZUELA, an eight-part riveting depiction of man's and woman's struggle against all that Mother Nature has to throw at them. The strangers were flown in, dropped off and abandoned in a remote corner of Venezuela's southern frontier a lost world that once lured explorers in search of El Dorado, the legendary City of Gold. They had only the clothes on their backs and a few basic supplies. Their goal? Find their way back to civilization.Viewers will meet the daring people who abandoned the comforts of home to test their ability to survive in one of the most physically and mentally demanding environments in the world.In the fall of 2010, a group of amateur hikers, campers and outdoor enthusiasts put their lives on hold to undertake the opportunity, and challenge, of a lifetime. After a three-day crash course in basic survival skills, including skills used by the Pemon Indians the indigenous Indians that inhabit this area of Venezuela, the volunteers were flown in and dropped off on top of 9,200-foot Mt. Roraima (the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel \"The Lost World\"). There they were given the first piece of a rudimentary map (additional pieces were given to the team along the route), a compass and a few basic tools and told to hike to civilization. They had no idea how far they would have to go or how long it would take them.Throughout their journey down the mountain, through dense jungle, across open savannah and down a river the group faced extreme challenges: hunger and exhaustion as well as Jaguars and venomous snakes and spiders. They also battled hypothermia, flash floods and raging storms. The team was forced to work together to scavenge for food, build shelters and protect themselves from these dangers not to mention the onslaught of biting insects attacking them incessantly.Their only lifeline was a GPS beacon they could activate to summon a search and rescue helicopter to evacuate them. And some chose to do just that.For all their struggles, the brave volunteers weren't being offered a million-dollar prize or seven-figure job at the end of their journey. Their only reward was the chance to have a life-changing experience.\n"
