            "Can one false accusation ruin a persons whole life? The story of Reputasyon begins with the idyllic life of Agnes de los Santos, whose family is respected by everyone in the small town of San Lucas. She dreams of becoming a teacher just like her mom and raising a family of her own with the man she loves. But her world shatters when her unexpected visit to their beloved governors home turns into a huge scandal in their town. How can she prove that shes not there for a midnight tryst? Will anyone believe her innocence? What happens once she discovers that shes merely used to cover up a much greater crime?"
