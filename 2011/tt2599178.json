            "Moving Numbers is an eight episode long political drama comedy series. It follows the hilariously dysfunctional campaign of Republican Congressman Robert Sanders (John Colton) for a senate seat for Pennsylvania. Congressman Sanders receives aid in his quest from characters including his Campaign Manager, Jason Mahoney (Peter McCain) and his loving wife, Beth (Monique Parent). The show's title refers to a campaign's goal - moving the poll numbers in their favor. The supporting cast includes everyone you'd expect to see in a political campaign, from campaign staffers and communications directors to pollsters and opposition researchers (the men and women who dig up the dirt on your political enemies) to advertising producers. The show, while fully scripted, has the feel of a zany reality show with ridiculous plotlines. The Pittsburgh Tribune Review described the show as \"Primary Colors on steroids.\" If you can't get enough political excitement during the electoral off-season, Moving Numbers can help you get your political fix.\n"
