        "plot outline": "BEN AND BURMAN is an original web series about two vertically-challenged, polar opposite roommates. Burman is the world's biggest scum-rat mooch, while Ben is an anal-retentive clean-freak. As best buddies, they take each other to their wit's end through agitated banter, plans gone awry, and a crack-squad of off-kilter friends and foes. Ben is the voice of reason, and Burman is the scheming loon. No matter how hard Ben tries to achieve success in romance, career aspirations, and personal tranquility, Burman finds a way to completely wreck everything. The series runs the gamut: Zombies, Nazis, Santa Claus, Supermodels, Time Travel, Robbery -- no subject is off limits. After not speaking since grade school, childhood best friends Ben and Burman reconnect after Burman shows up on Ben's doorstep, down on his luck. Ben reluctantly lets Burman sleep on the couch of his one-bedroom bachelor pad for \"a few nights.\" After a while, it becomes clear Burman has no intention of ever leaving - and Ben doesn't have the guts to kick him out. The boys begin to rely on each other, becoming inseparable: Burman needs Ben to support his freeloading lifestyle, and Ben needs Burman to bring a little chaos to an otherwise drab existence. The series thrusts the boys into endless ridiculous adventures in an off-beat, suburban neighborhood. The show melds a wacky cartoon world with gritty realism. Burman continually befriends vagrants, thieves, and children to assist in get-rich-quick schemes. Through it all, he drags Ben along - consequences be damned. As a result, Ben's love life, career, and finances become painfully unstable. With dozens of original characters and shockingly in-your-face humor, BEN AND BURMAN is the craziest web series to ever hit the Internet.",
