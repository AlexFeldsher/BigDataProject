Together they are hoping to take the Australian fashion scene by storm, but first, they will have to survive their summer, and earn their positions in the fashion food chain. Together Dom and Adrian will do all they can to win the hearts and minds of Bondi's locals. They will try to avoid their drug dealers at all costs, not miss any more Yoga classes, and challenge Sydney's most successful home grown fashion brand Ksodomi (formerly Tsodomi) for dominance of the Sydney Fashion scene. Together they will make a name for themselves in the suburb that stops for no one... And hopefully learn some life lessons along the way.",
