Being so famous and admirable in their own country, the stars have to deal with a whole new experience; they start from square one and have to fight their way up to the top all over again. Only now, it happens at a different and unfamiliar territory, without their families, away from their fans and with no support from their agents. They will be exposed to harsh criticism and competition, and will have to do all that in a foreign and unfamiliar language.",
