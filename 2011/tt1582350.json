            "An English couple, Sean and Beverly Lincoln, are the creators/producers of a long- running, highly acclaimed and very popular TV show on UK TV, \"Lyman's Boys\". After receiving yet another award for the show they are approached by a US TV executive. He wants to take them to the US and make a US version of the show. After much haggling and assurances that the show will remain largely unchanged they agree. Once in the US they discover that the proposed show is quite different to the UK version. Their greatest dismay, however, is reserved for the fact that their venerable lead actor is to be replaced by Friends star Matt Le Blanc.::grantss"
