He said he brought his 12 foot with him to be able to maneuver down flooded streets to get images of the flooding. Lohr said in no time at all, he heard people begging to be rescued. \"We just jumped into action. We got the boat in the water, me and my partner, and just started going out there and loading people on the boat - We did that for several hours that day. Went and cleared the houses and kind of switched roles from a journalist to a rescuer, but it wasn't our intent. But, when you're in that situation; what do you do? This is life or death.\" Lohr says he plans on being in Texas, both as a journalist and a rescuer, for at least another week.",
