He sold tens of millions of books and was nominated twice for the Academy awards and won 2 golden globes. But yet he could never write his own biography. At the age of 70 he invited his college journalist Yaron London to assist him in unfolding his life story. Kishon uses animation to 'bring back to life' Ephraim Kishon's persona and reenact the rare dialog, alongside intimate interviews, rare footage and 8 mm' home movies.",
