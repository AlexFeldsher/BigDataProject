Rauf was both mother and father to Ali and has devoted his life to Ali to help him forget the trauma he had endured. With the support of Rauf, whom he calls \"Mother\", Ali gets maritime training. He forgets that he is an orphan, thanks to Rauf's affection. When he is twenty eight years old, he is a handsome, mature and social sailor who can speak five languages. Derin, who is the daughter of ship-owner Tekin Mirkelamoglu, is on the verge of important decisions regarding her life. As she comes closer to the happy ending with her fiancee Yigit, for some reason she becomes unhappy. As the ship which carries Ali is docking, Derin wakes up with a different dream in that morning, but she is not aware that her life will change that day - For years, Ali did not want to work in ships which stop in Istanbul. After the big trauma in his life, he is angry at the city. After many years, he agrees to go there as his \"Rauf Mother\" is pining for Istanbul, but he has one condition; he will not set foot in the harbour. Whereas, Rauf has come to Istanbul especially for Ali. He is aware the fact that his disease has progressed. He is determined to reveal the secrets in Ali's past and entrust Ali in safe hands. For that reason, he finds the former box champion Sahin Vargi. When they set foot in the harbour, the events did not shape as Rauf had thought.
