It's a modus operandi not unlike the irreverent artistic strategies of the Dadaists or that of surrealist collages. Most often though, mash-up videos settle for laughs. The videos of Peet Gelderblom take the mash-up into conceptual territory, fully using the form's potential as a tool for essayist critique and questioning. For that is what his mash-ups aim to accomplish: they don't deal in definitive answers like a lot of video essays (try to) do, but instead evoke questions by juxtaposing footage from very different registers.",
