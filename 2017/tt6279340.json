            "Beth Briggs has spent her entire adult life afraid. She has witnessed her New York City neighborhood grow more dangerous, and feels helpless to change it. Paralyzing visions of being attacked make her withdraw into the safety of her closest companions: her sister, Alison, and her best friend, Kate. But secluding herself only makes Beth feel like a coward.The morning after Beth discovers that she has an inoperable brain tumor, she stumbles across a mugging. Ashamed of her past timidity, she pushes aside a vision of getting stabbed, and attempts to stop the assault. Beth is done being afraid. She has nothing left to lose.As she rushes in, everything plays out just as it did in her vision--she dodges the knife, she knees him in the groin--and uses her advantage to take him down. The visions that fed her fears are actually premonitions, and with this newfound power, she can finally make a difference.Meanwhile, her friend Kate, a cop with the NYPD, is assigned an undercover mission to infiltrate a new player in the criminal underworld. Hugh Potts and his gang have quickly become one of the largest human trafficking operations in the city, and are gaining strength and resources at an alarming rate.While undercover, Kate realizes the extent of Potts' psychopathy, and her desire to neutralize him begins to conflict with her task of collecting information and evidence. Having no other recourse, she turns to Beth.If they can work together, Beth and Kate will surely be able to stop his syndicate. But he is not an easy foe to eliminate, and once Beth is on his radar, he will turn the whole world upside down just to teach her that there is always more to lose.Beth Briggs will not be underestimated. She will not back down. She will see this through to the end because now she is . . . Mirage."
