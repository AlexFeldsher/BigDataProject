And that art degree she's spent four years earning isn't going to much use. Set in summer 2016, a time of political and social unrest, Nilay is swept into the unfamiliar world of activism, which for the first time forces her outside of herself. As she tries to keep her mind from falling victim to the seductive Los Angeles party scene, those around her continue to challenge her ideology, sexuality, and overall purpose, making Nilay question exactly where she fits in.",
