        "plot outline": "In this Spotlight, TCM pays homage to all those creatures that go bump in the night - also during the day, in water, on land and in the sky. Our roundup includes five TCM premieres, introducing us to a quintet of creepy crawlies that are guaranteed to haunt our dreams, chill our spines and occasionally even tickle our funny bones. Reptilicus (1961) is a prehistoric reptile that is discovered in Denmark after regenerating itself from a portion of its tail, and begins a rampage on the panic-stricken streets of Copenhagen. (This Danish-American production was released in different versions in the two countries; we're screening the U.S. version.) The Deadly Mantis (1957) follows another millions-year-old creature that begins to stir--this time a 200-foot long praying mantis that terrorizes Canada and New York City. Empire of the Ants (1977), loosely based on a story by H.G. Wells, concerns another variety of giant insects--marauding ants created by a toxic spill in the Florida Everglades--with top-billed Joan Collins among those battling the pesky creatures. Return of the Fly (1959) was the first sequel to the well-regarded 1958 sci-fi horror pic The Fly, about a scientist who mutates into a giant housefly. Vincent Price is the only cast member returning from the original film. Other creatures include such classics as Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), King Kong (1933), Mothra (1962), The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), Rodan (1958, English-language version), Godzilla, King of the Monsters (1956), The Wasp Woman (1960) and Swamp Thing (1982).",
