Enigmatic, unrelenting and charismatic, we follow DCI Gabriel Markham as he is propelled in an obsessive hunt for a serial killer who left a mark on him both physically and mentally. As the clock ticks back, and Gabriel's personal and professional lives unfurl, we explore the painful psychology of a man disfigured, while the shock waves from the crime ripple out in reverse. Alongside a thrilling chase to catch a brutal killer, Rellik explores the very nature of motivation, as we delve deeper into the past to uncover the events that shape a person into who they will become.",

            "Starting at the end, with a suspect caught, the series moves backwards in time through the string of gruesome murders, gradually unraveling the truth. Enigmatic, unrelenting and charismatic, we follow DCI Gabriel Markham as he is propelled in an obsessive hunt for a serial killer who left a mark on him both physically and mentally. As the clock ticks back, and Gabriel's personal and professional lives unfurl, we explore the painful psychology of a man disfigured, while the shock waves from the crime ripple out in reverse. Alongside a thrilling chase to catch a brutal killer, _Rellik_ (qv) explores the very nature of motivation, as we delve deeper into the past to uncover the events that shape a person into who they will become."
