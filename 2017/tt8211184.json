            "Prominent cyber threats like malware and ransomware continue to jeopardize the security of companies around the world. Businesses that previously did not use Cisco security products are now relying on it. The threat landscape has changed significantly, and businesses of all sizes need help. As many businesses are realizing their vulnerabilities, Cisco's Cybersecurity Distinguished Engineer, Mike Storm, is documenting real-life Cisco customer success stories using Cisco Security. By working as a team with their Cisco Partners and Resellers, Cisco customers are able to finally experience a completely integrated security solution that helps protect their network, endpoints, cloud, internet, and email from cyberattacks.Whether it's a small medical office with HIPPA compliance data requirements, a large organization protecting lots of personal data or even a high visibility business with a strong reputation to uphold, Cisco is always on the scene - keeping businesses safe across the globe, one customer at a time. The Cisco IT Security Makeover series documents the before, during and after real-life experiences of a Cisco IT Security Makeover, showcasing the customer problem before, the installation and proof of value during and the positive business outcomes afterwards. With this three-phase walk-through of the makeover, Storm uses his intellect and wit to illustrate the transformation Cisco Security provides to our clients' security posture and peace of mind. In addition, Storm exemplifies the face-to-face, two-way conversation that allows for Cisco to create business specific solutions. Seasons 1, 2, & 3 cover diverse business settings to show how solutions can always be tailored to different business needs."
