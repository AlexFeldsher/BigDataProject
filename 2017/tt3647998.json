Believed to be long dead, he returns home to London from Africa to inherit what is left of his father's shipping empire and rebuild a life for himself. But his father's legacy is a poisoned chalice, and with enemies lurking in every dark corner, James must navigate increasingly complex territories to avoid his own death sentence. Encircled by conspiracy, murder and betrayal, a dark family mystery unfolds in a combustible tale of love and treachery.",

He soon discovers that his father had many debts and even more enemies who all now want him dead as well. Both the Crown and the US want his father's small but valuable land on Nootka Sound in North America at all costs, while his main business competitor, the East India Company, wants him dead either way. After barely surviving several assassination attempts, Delaney finds some allies including his half-sister and their supposed stepmother he never knew about.",

The US is at war with England and the island is of great value to both sides. Delaney soon finds himself in the sights of three parties - the US government, the British government and the East India Company - and they are all willing to use whatever means necessary to gain possession of the island, including killing him.::grantss"
