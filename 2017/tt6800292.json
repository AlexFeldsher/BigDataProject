Jake, an out of work and down on his luck Zombie Hunter, is subcontracted by the city council to use his specialized talents in hunting down, containing and removing the remaining undead from Fremont City streets. Jake and his unconventional team comprise a duly appointed special task force called the Post Mortem Subdual and Acquisitions Unit, otherwise known as the Zomb Squad. Whether it be an underground zombie fight ring, or a stray ambler locked in Annie May Sheffler's laundry shack, the Zomb Squad take their duties in keeping the streets of Fremont City safe from the tooth and claw of the living dead quite seriously (most of the time). When the political machinations of Chief Medical Examiner Clyde Davis put the Coroner's Office at odds with Jake and his team in a jurisdictional row, its only a matter of time before some heads start to roll. Armed with his trademark war paint and wit, Jake and the Zomb Squad take on both the bureaucrats and the undead and manage to demonstrate that they are anything but 'dead men walking'.
