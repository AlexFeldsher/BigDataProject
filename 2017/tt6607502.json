As an osteologist, she reconstructs skeletal remains of animals in her atelier at home when receiving job offers from museums. Deeply inspired by the beauty and majesty of bodies, her eccentricity is remarkable. \"Dead bodies speak eloquently.\" says Sakurako, at the events of examining incidents. She observes bodies and the crime scenes very carefully, and reveals the truth one by one. Kujo Sakurako, the beautiful osteologist, resolves the cases with her expertise hearing the \"voice\" of bones. How does this extraordinary heroine resolve cases?",

            "Born in an affluent family, Sakurako is grown beautiful but rather spirited and speaks roughly. As an osteologist, she reconstructs skeletal remains of animals in her atelier at home when receiving job offers from museums. Deeply inspired by the beauty and majesty of bodies, her eccentricity is remarkable. \"Dead bodies speak eloquently.\" says Sakurako, at the events of examining incidents. She observes bodies and the crime scenes very carefully, and reveals the truth one by one. Kujo Sakurako, the beautiful osteologist, resolves the cases with her expertise hearing the \"voice\" of bones. How does this extraordinary heroine resolve cases?::Fuji TV"
