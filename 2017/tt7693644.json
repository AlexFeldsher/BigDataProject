            "_The Core_ (qv) is a dissection of the brilliant minds from which genre films spring. Whether it's a demo on head explosions, or a primer on avoiding predictable jump scares, _The Core_ (qv) busts open the traditional talk show and plays with its guts. Host Mickey Keating and his guests examine the onscreen techniques and real-life psychologies that strike fear into our very core. We'll turn you on to what's thrilling in filmmaking today, without subjecting you to a chat with that dude Greg from film school."
