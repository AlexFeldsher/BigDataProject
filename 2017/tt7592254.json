Looking back on her first interview with Dahmer, Nancy highlights on-and-off-camera conversations detailing Dahmer's disturbing crimes through his own words, giving insight into his dark, depraved manner and reasons for killing. The two-night event offers an in-depth look at the man and monster that was Jeffrey Dahmer with new and exclusive interviews from those closest to him, including parents Lionel and Shari Dahmer, who haven't spoken about this case or their son publicly in over 20 years, and surviving victims Billy Capshaw and Preston Davis, who have decided to finally break their silence about what happened to them. Their unique experiences with Dahmer throughout various stages of his life expose a serial killer unlike any other -- one not motivated by the impulse to kill, but rather the desire to exercise control.",
