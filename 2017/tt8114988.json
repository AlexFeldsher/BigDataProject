The series dives into the daily coping strategies of women living with advanced breast cancer, plus the families and friends who provide encouragement and support, and includes insights from medical experts leading the charge to combat the disease. Over 255,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer this year, and over 41,000 will die, with metastatic breast cancer being the leading cause of those fatalities.1 Despite these staggering statistics, there are signs of hope. Treatments for metastatic breast cancer are improving, and they continue to help people with the disease live longer and healthier lives. In this new series, Roberts, whose public struggles with cancer and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were inspirational for millions of Americans, shines a light on the latest approaches to support and care for women with metastatic breast cancer. She shares the realities of managing and living with this disease through firsthand accounts from researchers, health care professionals, and patients at the forefront.",
