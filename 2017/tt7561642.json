            "Bella (Jessica May Drociunas), who grew up in Madrid and in Milan, and Hazar Aga (Tolga Mendi), who grew up with the sunshine of the other Cukurova, kneaded in the tribe. Although they are the people of two different cultures and traditions, these two couples, who can not prevent their love and marry, hold Çukurova's, Bozok Tribe's path. Bella is now the new beginning of the Bozok Tribe. The new bride is the only daughter of the Grand Ambassador of Turkey who came to the world in Spain with a father and a high-society mother. In addition to being knowledgeable and vigilant, she is extremely caring, close to the canine, but as much as she is. She jumped to the leave of her life's love and closed her eyes to Çukurova. Her eyes were more blind than in love, as she anticipated that the sheriff's shore alliance would open her eyes. According to him, everyone is in good shape.::ahmetkozan"
