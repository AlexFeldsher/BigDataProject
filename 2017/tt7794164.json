            "Death, mourning, addictions, strange sexual habits, concealed sins and taboos in family life. These are problems that we might have experienced up-close in our lives, but in most cases, we ignore them and do not or very rarely talk about it.\nWhat is the life like for a gay couple living in the countryside? What was the priest going through, who became an alcoholic from the overconsumption of altar wine? Why does a swinger couple reveal their identity?\nThe documentary series \"Taboos without taboos\" explores taboo topics we do not want to be confronted with, despite it's happening in front of our eyes, sometimes even in our own family or immediate environment. The six-part, self- produced series presents one specific taboo subject through personal stories in each one-hour episode. We got to know real protagonists though real conversations in their real environment (at home, at the swinger club, at the crematorium, during hospital visit, at their workplace, with their family, at a weed selling bar, in prison, on the football pitch, during therapy sessions). Each talk focuses on the process of coping with the protagonist's situation, how they processed the traumatic events and found the way out of their situation.\nThe series \"Taboos without taboos\" commissioned by AMC/ Spektrum was developed from an own idea by one of the leading advertising agencies in Hungary, ACG Budapest.\nIn 2018, the series was awarded the \"Best Documentary\" at Mexico International Film Festival and the \"Best Documentary Television Film\" at Jahorina Film Festival.\nGenre: Documentary\nDirector: Norbert Pálinkás\nWriters: Zsófia Zurbó, Anna Tóth, Sára Mega, Ádám Simon\nProducer: Endre Mentes\nLine producer: Tamás Jakus, Nikoletta Fehér\nCinematographers: Eszter Csepeli (DOP), Kristóf Becsey\nEditor: Réka Pálfalvi\nHost: Szabolcs Thuróczy\nProduction company: ACG Budapest"
