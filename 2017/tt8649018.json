        "plot outline": "Pregnant girls at the age of 13 or grandmothers at the age of 26 are of no surprise in Colombian slums. In the poorest social class, violence against women is especially striking: rape, sexual abuse or sex trafficking of minors happen on everyday basis. Teenage pregnancies are extremely prevalent. Colombia is a country that experienced a brutal 50-years long civil war as well as ruthless drug cartels. The long escalation of violence has caused millions of Colombian people to suffer from extreme poverty. The situation in Colombia has forced over 7 million people to leave their homes. Most of them now live in slums. Such a situation is the most difficult for women, who are additionally victims of violence and stigmatization resulting from a characteristic to Latin America machismo culture. Dominika Kulczyk, the President of the Kulczyk Foundation, together with Catalina Escobar reaches out to those inhabitants of slums that are most in need, offers them a chance to change their lives. Catalina is a wise, strong and beautiful woman, who - as a result of her own personal tragedy - has given up her business career in order to fight for bringing young mothers back from the hell of violence and poverty. She has been running her Juanfe Foundation for over 10 years now, and every year she helps 250 teenage mothers. Kulczyk Foundation has supported Juanfe by donating 100 thousand dollars for workshops devoted to teenage mothers, food and help with their children. \"Cataline is an amazing woman: she's wise, strong and warm. And she's doing amazing job, solving terrifying problems. That's why we support her Foundation\", emphasizes Dominika Kulczyk. \"Colombia: Teenage Mothers\" appeared in a TV series, \"Domino Effect\"",
