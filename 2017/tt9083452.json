The first season of the series really focused on the struggles gay men have to go through to find love and peace in this extremely judgemental world, especially having homophobic fathers. Season Two of Breathe released fall of 2018, this time with a different perspective. Instead of following Trey's life only, the story line now dives deeper into the lives of everyone else in the show. Trey's current relationship with his boyfriend and his parents. Teresa trying to figure out who she is and what she wants. Finding out the truth between Ken and Rob relationship back in the day, and what happened with Ken and Trey. Rob dealing with depression and letting go of Ken. Bree/Freshie trying to be the sweetheart but struggling juggling her heart with her sexual desires. Ally and Chelsea seeking an interest in two women. Instead of the show being just about Trey, and gay men - the ladies are now able to tell their stories as well.",
