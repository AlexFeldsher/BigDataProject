Thibaut is now a role model in Hicham's quest to find his own personal, sexual and political identity. Hicham admires his fights. He's fascinated by his abundant and politically engaged world. He's envious of his apparent strength. But, as he learns to know him better, Hicham comes to see more of Thibaut's faults and contradictions. This force is a mask. To keep it on, Thibaut can swerve perilously. In order to find himself, Hicham will have to trace his own path."
