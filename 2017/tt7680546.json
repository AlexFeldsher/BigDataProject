            "In my doctoral thesis I showed that, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the universe must have had a beginning. But the theory of relativity did not say how the universe had begun. Since then, a key focus of my research has been to better understand the origin of the universe. I am pleased to present a new film which explains the model I developed over the years, initially with James Hartle and then later with Thomas Hertog and others. In \"Before the Big Bang 5: The No Boundary Proposal\", Jim, Thomas and I guide you through our No Boundary Proposal for the quantum origin of the universe and reveal how it can explain some of the universe's deepest mysteries. The film is free to view and part of a series developed by Youtuber skydivephil to explore competing models of the early universe. We hope you share and enjoy.::Stephen Hawking"
