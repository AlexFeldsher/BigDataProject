Each week, Stefanick assumes the duties of the people he profiles, working alongside crawfish farmers, surfers, hang glider pilots, missionaries to the homeless, miracle historians, and other faith-filled professionals: average folks overcoming loss and embracing the mystery of life. You'll walk away from Real Life Catholic with more than just a glimpse into unfamiliar territory - pilgrimaging to World Youth Day, swimming in cranberries, firing rifles at piñatas and touring through Na Pali by helicopter, for example. If you're like us, you'll end up grasping a new appreciation for how faith works beyond our own natural capacity. Don't take our word for it; see it for yourself.
