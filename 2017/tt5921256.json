Valentina Vasilievna (Irina Rozanova) appears in their life - she is Anatoly Ivanovichs ex-wife and Sergey's mother, whom everyone considered dead for a long time.

And when Olga tries to figure out what had really happened in the Korostylevs family thirty years ago, it nearly costs her life. What does the woman who calls herself Sergeys mother need? Is she really his mother? Will Olga be able to save her family in a fight with a clever and ruthless enemy?"
