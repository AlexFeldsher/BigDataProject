Nami isn't really good with domestic chores in general, including cooking or cleaning, but she has a very strong sense of justice and it would be very ill-advised to make her angry. She was born and raised without a single relative and had to experience a life without knowing what it means to love or be loved. By making friends with other housewives, who she occasionally saves from various predicaments, and by cuddling close to her husband, it's the first time for Nami to experience true kindness and warmth in her life.",

            "Isayama Nami, in order to start over her life and to find happiness, married the man she fell in love with at first sight during a blind date and moved to a quiet high-end residential area. Nami isn't really good with domestic chores in general, including cooking or cleaning, but she has a very strong sense of justice and it would be very ill-advised to make her angry. She was born and raised without a single relative and had to experience a life without knowing what it means to love or be loved. By making friends with other housewives, who she occasionally saves from various predicaments, and by cuddling close to her husband, it's the first time for Nami to experience true kindness and warmth in her life.::Ahloyz"
