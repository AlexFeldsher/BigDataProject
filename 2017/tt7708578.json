In seven episodes the protagonist Helen Fares goes on a journey through futuristic technologies. She meets virtual friends, learns to steer a drone with her brain and to hack her own DNA. Encounters with experts in the US, Japan and Britan provide context to the posed question: Are we evolving into a new species - the Homo Digitalis? Simultaneously Homo Digitalis is a scientific experiment. In a playful test either as chatbot or as website the user can find out his or her personal future.",
