        "plot outline": "Ohrid is a large town in southwestern Macedonia on the shore of Lake Ohrid. A town of vast history and heritage, it was made a UNESCO heritage site in 1980. Nestled between high mountains up to 2,800 m and Lake Ohrid, it is not only a place of historic significance but also of outstanding natural beauty. The lake itself is over three million years old. Factually accurate and based on extensive historical research, indicate that Ohrid is one of the oldest human settlements in all of Europe. Ohrid town is first mentioned in Greek documents from 353 BCE, when it was known as Lychnidos - or, \"the city of light.\" - \"a precious stone that emits light\". The sacred architecture of Ohrid is prominent within the urban landscape. It includes early basilicas, monasteries, and medieval churches; are located in a manner that ensures each one enjoys a view of the lake and sunlight. Numerous archaeological vestiges dating to prehistory can be found on the site of the old city. The convergence of well-conserved natural values with the quality and diversity of its cultural, material and spiritual heritage makes this region truly unique. The city of the immortal Ohrid is the sublime lakeside point that for many represents the culmination of the Macedonian experience, a kingdom of light and water, a repository of ancient ruins from Macedonia's earlier kingdoms. Ohrid is the jewel in Macedonia's crown.",
