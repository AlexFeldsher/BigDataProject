        "plot outline": "Erik, 24, is in a very difficult situation. He is a quiet, somewhat shy, young man, the middle child raised in a very traditional family, with his younger sister, Louise, and older brother, Christian, three years his senior. Christian, a charming extrovert, admired by everyone, was successfully brought up to take over the top job in the family business. Two years ago, however, Erik's life changed dramatically when his beloved brother died in a tragic car accident. Everyone was shocked and deeply saddened. What's more, the responsibility of continuing the family firm passed to the underprepared and sensitive Erik. The pressure is enormous, as it would be for anyone in his situation - yet there is one huge difference between Erik and other young people in a similar position: Erik is the Crown Prince of Denmark - and the top job that awaits him when his father, Valdemar, dies, is that of King of Denmark ... THE KING is the story of a young man's search for identity and meaning within the destiny that has befallen him. It is an examination, from within, of the nature, emotions and mechanics of monarchy, as experienced first-person by the people who live it. Crown Prince Erik's family is a troubled one. Marred by the death of the heir-apparent, the royal family suffers deeply disturbed relationships and harbours a devastating secret, which could potentially bring about the end of the 1,000-year-old Danish Monarchy should it ever see the light of day. Cracks in the façade have already started to appear ... Erik and his family may be royal - but they're still just a family - a genetically bound group of human beings, dealing with the exact same hopes and fears as everyone else. They're driven by the same need to find love and acceptance and driven by the same desire to lead a meaningful existence in a life that, as fate would have it, is anything but ordinary. Though they must outwardly project the image of a model family, inwardly this is certainly not the case, and the series deals with the strain of living a troubled personal life under constant public scrutiny. THE KING plays out as an epic family saga - but it's also an intimate love story. A tale about how a chance encounter with another human being can change your life forever. It is said that royal families lead three different lives: A public life, a public-private life - and a private private life. THE KING story is set in the deeply private realm of a royal family in crisis and tells the story of a troubled young man who is about to face the challenge of a lifetime when the monarchy and everything he has ever known disastrously fall to pieces.",
