By going deep inside their minds, we get swept up into the powerful, hopeful visions for how their soccer careers have prepared them for success in whatever they do. This is starkly contrasted with the harsh reality of their profound stories of frustration, financial hardship, sacrifice and despair. An enormous amount of pressure, time and money is invested in these athletes to win a national title and we get to witness first-hand, the real life, behind the scenes journey on the field, off the field, and everything in between.",
