Shahzeb's mother Nazo don't want this so she escaped Sammi with the help of Rashid, the servant and half-brother of Rab Nawaz. Rashid sends her into his girlfriend Chandi's home where her son Salar starts liking her and finally marries her when her mother refuses to marry him with a girl of Rahim Yar Khan. Waqas is in search of Sammi to kill her because she is unusable and their parents agree. Salar is kidnapped and so Waqas leaves Salar and Salar dies in an accident.
