        "plot outline": "On the 200th anniversary of the opening of the Royal Canal, three of Ireland's leading musicians take a nostalgic trip down the waterway, exploring its rich musical heritage along the way. The Royal Canal opened in 1817. 200 years later and following a serious decline, the Royal has been restored to its former glory. The 145 km waterway connects the Liffey to the Shannon meandering through Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath and Longford. As well as passing through some stunning and historical landscapes, the Royal flows through some of our richest musical heritage. This series celebrates the bicentenary of the Royal Canal by taking a trip along it in an old barge. Three generations of Irish musicians, Jim Lockhart (HORSLIPS), Fiachna Ó Braonáin (HOTHOUSE FLOWERS) and singer/songwriter Fiach Moriarty travel the Royal Canal. Throughout their journey they explore some of the historical sites along the way and stop off to play music with some of Ireland's leading musicians. Travelling at 5 km/h on an old barge while negotiating 46 locks, the pace of this series is dictated by the mode of transport. This is a nostalgic, gentle trip down a musical memory lane celebrating the songs of our past in a vessel from a bygone age.",
