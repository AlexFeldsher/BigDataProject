            "A young boy named Johnny dreams of being a great fighter, but after a very costly tragedy that took place at a rally against the government, he decides to devote himself to changing the fate of his country as his brother had done before him. His acts however attract the government's attention, which now labels him as an enemy of the nation. On his journey, Johnny counts on Matt, a technology genius, Jaque, an Indian who had her tribe decimated in a government standoff, Mc X, a singer who had his family killed by corrupt cops, Lanny, an ex-policewoman blinded in a confrontation with bandits and Gigante, a police officer who does not agree with the government's directives. Together, they become _Os Duvidosos_ (qv) (The Doubtful), a group walking on the knife's edge between being bandits judged by media, and heroes for whom the nation has always hoped for."
