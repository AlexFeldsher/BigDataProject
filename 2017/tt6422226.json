When a genius composer with a hidden identity meets a girl with a beautiful voice, it is love at first sound. Finding true love with hidden identities, though, is a bit complicated. Kang Han Kyul (Lee Hyun Woo) is a famous, and very talented, composer. Having worked for a famous band long before they were stars, he has achieved a lot more in his youth than most do in their careers. However, he has fallen into a deep depression and no longer seems to have any motive to live. That is until he hears a voice that strikes a chord in his heart. Yoon So Rim (Joy) is a high school student. She has a voice unlike any Kang Han Kyul has ever heard. Yoon So Rim sees the pain in the sound composer's heart. Through her kindness and serenity, she convinces him to return to life. And through her voice, she makes her way into his heart. The problem, though, is that Kang Han Kyul intentionally hid his identity from Yoon So Rim. So for a man who has fallen in love, is it even possible for it to be real when you are hiding your true who you really are?",
