On his first day, Ryan not only learns what his new job entails, but, also finds himself in the midst of a heated employee vs employee battle as a new shift lead promotion hangs in the balance. Adam takes Ryan along with a plot to keep a rather self-important employee out of the promotion while Oscar shows Ryan the ropes.    "
