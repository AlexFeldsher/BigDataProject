            "LOGLINE: Based on the web comedy series \"Who...\", \"Beauty and the Baller\" is a single-camera television comedy series about a pro athlete and his hot down-to-earth wife and what their life is like off of the court. Despite their fame and fortune, at the end of the day JOHN AND DEENA CASTLE are just like any other couple when it comes to resolving problems, managing family and friends, and making sure the love that brought them together keeps them together. SYNOPSIS: Everyone thinks DEENA (Diandra Lyle of Paramount Network's \"American Woman\"), 28, hit the lottery because she married pro basketball star JOHN \"HOT HANDS\" CASTLE, 28 (Akeem Smith of VH1's \"Single Ladies: Season 1\" and \"Teen Wolf\"). But if you hear her tell it, John is the lucky one because The Bible says \"he who findeth a wife findeth a good thing-- especially if her name is Deena.\" (Ok, that last part isnt in The Bible-- Deena remixed the verse). To make sure they don't lose their fortune like so many other pro athletes, Deena hires best friend/C.P.A. TINA (Kimberly Dooley) to manage their finances; to make sure they're healthy so they can enjoy their fortune, Deena hires her feisty favorite uncle JALIL (Charles Reese) to prepare all of their meals and live in their guest house. But Jalil will tell you in a Mississippi minute that he's a five-star gourmet chef not the help, so Deena does the smart thing and hires loveable Columbian national MARTEEN (Calo Rodriguez) to be Jalil's assistant and keep their L.A. mansion in order. The Castles live in Kimberlywood-- a gated community for the rich and famous-- and are surrounded by high-profile neighbors like former child star-turned-insurance salesman BOBBY JINGLES (the late Tommy Ford - star of the classic sitcom \"Martin\"), two-time baby mama-to-the-stars KYM BANKS (pop/soul singing star Karyn White), Latino tv action star ROBERT MONTANA (Jaime Zevallos) and his hot opinionated wife CRYSTAL (Laura Soares), and fun-loving, seasoned basketball couple LORETTA (Shoneji Loraine) and MARIO SHAW (Dorien Wilson - star of \"Dream On\" and \"The Parkers\"). Despite four years of marriage, Deena still feels she has something to prove to John's family-- especially her always-got-something-to-say-about-something mother-in-law DELORES (Judy Pace-Flood). Other celebrity sightings in Season 1: John's hipster stepfather MR WINCHESTER (Art Evans), the Castle's powerhouse attorney E. CHERYL COPELAND (EnVogue co-founder/lead singer Cindy Herron-Braggs), the Castle'*s Hollywood spin doctor MEG ANDERSON (Gwendolyn Osborne-Smith of \"The Price Is Right\"), tv courtroom star JUDGE NIECY (pop/soul/gospel icon Deniece Williams), Kimberlywood neighbor/\"Ghostbusters\" Grammy-winning singer-songwriter RAY PARKER JR. (who's also one of the shows executive producers and whose timeless Top 10 gem \"You Can't Change That\" is \"Beauty and the Baller's\" theme song), and local restaurant owner SLY STONE (played by the legend himself). Like the peerless star of \"I Love Lucy\", \"Beauty and the Baller\" often finds its First Lady caught up in some drama. Like Houdini, Deena always tries to find creative ways to escape her hot messes. Even though the Castles have it going on, John and Deena aren't together for the stuff, the beauty or the bank-- they're in it for the love.\n"
