As it turns out, fate had a different plan for her when she helps a drunk Korean guy beaten by gangsters in one of Manila's bars. After a few days, the mysterious guy comes back to thank her, and much to her surprise, it's her dream oppa, Kim Jun Ho. Sparks fly and the two of them eventually become friends.
