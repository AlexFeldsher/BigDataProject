            "Kally is a regular 14-year-old girl until she sits at the piano and her raw talent is revealed. Raw talent since Kally hasn't had much formal training. She's a diamond in the rough and, due to her lack of formal training and exposure, her gift remains under nurtured in her small town.\nEverything changes when a video of Kally playing at a school recital is overheard by PROFESSOR ABRANKHAUSEN, the head of the piano department at the country's premier music conservatory. Professor Abrankhausen offers the very young Kally the opportunity to attend the prestigious school.After Kally decides to leave her small town, she moves to the big city and in with her father, MIKE, with whom she has had limited contact since her parents divorced when she was a little girl.\nMike lives with his fun and quirky brother, UNCLE CHARLY, who is an over the top inventor whose whimsical creations rarely work, but always comes through when he sets out to help Kally.Kally struggles to learn the discipline and rules of a classical musician without losing her originality. All of this while trying to secure a hyper-competitive scholarship so she can pay the tuition her parents cannot afford.\nNow attending a challenging school in the big city, Kally has to prove herself in the new world of gifted, older rivals, including the uber-talented, but ruthless GLORIA.\nGloria's overly strict and demanding father, PROFESSOR SKYLER is one of the main Professors at the conservatory and is adamant that his daughter must win the scholarship for which Kally is competing.Kally has another soul-searching problem: she loves writing pop songs, something that goes against Allegro Conservatory of Music's classical music only policy. Kally beings to compose original songs that mashup her beloved pop and classical music. She posts her first one online under the assumed identity of @Mica635 and, to her own surprise, it goes viral! It isn't long before everyone is wondering who the girl behind the mashup is, including her own new neighbors and friends at the conservatory. The powerful lyrics Kally writes not only create the soundtrack for our series, but allow the audience to experience our protagonist's inner journey through music.Kally meets a whole new group of friends from her new school and her new neighborhood but among them the most important is her cute neighbor, DANTE, the lead singer of a local pop band and Kally's love interest.\nHe has two bandmates, brothers ALEX and KEVIN, who when not rehearsing, spend most of their time trying to impress girls at the local hangout spot.Dante's sister TINA, who quickly becomes Kally's best friend and partner in crime discovers Kally is the mysterious @Mica635 before anyone else. It is this secret, which will be revealed to her friends, family, and teachers at the end of the season, that will cause most of the conflicts, test most, if not all, of her relationships, and provide equal doses of emotion and fun each episode."
