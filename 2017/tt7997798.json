            "\"The Black Square\" is a series of positions and contrasts regarding art and its movements. Each episode illustrates, in succession, the evolution of ideas in the Arts in the 20th century, as well as the emerging art of the 21st century, with creative tools such as animation, video art and performance, and a philosophical, psychoanalytic and sociological interpretation. The entire series, through 14 episodes, seeks to define and explain both the ideological and the political character of modern art. Beginning with the birth of Dada and the successive movements that follow, the series runs through the vision and high aesthetics of abstract art and Russian avant-garde and enters postmodern cultural logic and ephemeral art in counterpoint to art movements in the era of rebellion. Exploring the lineage of the term \"performance\" from the 1960s to the present, the series' ending point investigates the dynamic relationship of art to healing. The aim is to highlight the active relationship of art to reality at a political, social and aesthetic level and to explore the perpetual human necessity of producing culture. The first episode titled \"Cabaret Voltaire\" explores the Dada movement, and the next episode regards Dada v/s Futurism. Surrealism is explored in episodes Surrealism I - A surrealistic dream and Surrealism II - The Surrealistic Revolution. The Episode titled \"The Blue Rider\" is dedicated to Wassily Kandinsky, and the episode titled \"How black is the Black Square?\" to Kazimir Malevich. Postmodernism is explored in episodes Postmodernism I - The passage and Postmodernism II. The last episodes are titled Aesthetics and Politics, Art and Rebellion, Performance art, The performer in the 21st century, Anthropology and Art, and Art as Therapy."
