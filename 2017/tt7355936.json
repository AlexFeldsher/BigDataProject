            "Shahira is a 39-year-old woman who has just woken up from a 20-year coma and realizes that everything has changed. The world she once knew, where the Malay rap music and girl bands are at the height of its popularity and smart technology was at its infancy, no longer exists. Replacing it is a world where everything revolves around technology and society whose lives are intrinsically intertwined with social media. Even Shahira's friends have all changed, from young carefree teenagers to busy mothers and career women. Now Shahira has to adapt and learn about everything that is new in 2017. However, mentally Shahira still feels stuck in the past and cannot seem to move on, especially when it comes to her music, her friends and her first love, Zaid, who is now nowhere to be found. She now has to embrace the changing times and shake off her past."
