Theodor's maternal aunt, who goes by the name of Lola, has sailed the seven seas for as long as she can remember. She can tie knots, raise the sails and climb all the way up the ship's highest mast. She is also a master storyteller. Every day is a new adventure, whether Theodor finds a letter in a bottle, catches fresh provisions or joins the hunt for the great white whale, Moby Dick. But have no fear - with Lola at his side and her wondrous tales, Theodor is ready to overcome every challenge the oceans can throw at him - in true shipmate style.",
