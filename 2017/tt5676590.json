            "After a few years' hiatus, Robert Webb and David Mitchell are \"back\" with a new six-part comedy series.Following the death of Stephen's (David Mitchell) father Laurie, the family all get together to see how he has divided his estate which included a country pub called \"The John Barleycorn\". All are interested to keep the pub as a going concern with their own contributions.Much to Stephen's surprise his \"brother\" Andrew (Robert Webb) arrives from via a flight from the USA and also wants to contribute. He's so upset that his \"Dad\" has died.It turns out, however, that Andrew was in fact one of the father's many foster children, and they had taken in Andrew for five months in 1987.Despite Stephen's protests, Andrew indeed was very much an admirer of Laurie and regarded the five months he spent in the family as the best five months of his life. Stephen seems to remember it all rather differently.Themes of the rivalry between the two brothers - such a critical part of Mitchell and Webb comedies - abound throughout the series, with constant attempts by Stephen to show Andrew up for a rascal. However, much to the chagrin of Stephen, they all seem to be reasonably answered by Andrew, gaining him sympathy from the family and friends, and further alienating Stephen.The show was written by Simon Blackwell who we all know so well from\nPeep Show\" which concluded after nine series after (as David Mitchell explains) the actors were simply getting too old to continue playing those characters.The programmes were directed by Ben Palmer, and originally aired on UK's Channel 4.With so many loose ends and storylines open at the end of the sixth show, it wasn't a huge surprise that despite disappointing ratings figures (like \"Peep Show\") a second series was announced in November 2017."
