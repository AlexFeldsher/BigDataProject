            "_Feud_ (qv) is an anthology series which dramatizes specific periods of real life feuds, focusing on one feud per season. In season one, the feud between legendary Hollywood actresses 'Joan Crawford' (qv) and 'Bette Davis' (qv) is presented. Although their mutual dislike is well known before their first and only professional collaboration on _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)_ (qv) which is at the seeming twilight of their professional lives as actresses, others around them may have their own motives for fueling that dislike. The two actresses may fall prey to those external machinations, despite both women needing to work together toward a common goal of a movie success and thus professional survival.::Huggo",
            "\"_What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962)_ (qv)\" co-stars 'Joan Crawford' (qv) and 'Bette Davis' (qv), two of the most prolific actresses in the history of Hollywood, had a famous feud while shooting the 1962 film. This docudrama from Emmy-winning producer 'Ryan Murphy' (qv) (\"_American Horror Story (2011)_ (qv)') recalls the details of the legendary rivalry the Oscar-winning actresses had while filming the movie and extended well after the cameras stopped rolling. '_Feud_ (qv)' recalls how the ladies struggled to hang on to fame in the twilight of their careers as they faced such obstacles such as ageism, sexism and misogyny. Leading the acclaimed cast are 'Jessica Lange' (qv) and 'Susan Sarandon' (qv) -- portraying Crawford and Davis, respectively -- who have won three Oscars between them.::Jwelch5742"
