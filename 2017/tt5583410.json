            "A recreation from one of the world's greatest jam sessions. On December 4th, 1956 Carl Perkins' career was flying high from his hit \"Blue Suede Shoes.\" New to the scene, Jerry Lee Lewis is brought in to work on a new song with Perkins. Then, low and behold, super star Elvis Presley and country music legend Johnny Cash stop by the studio for a visit. The songs they sang on that epic day became the concept for Million Dollar Quartet, a fun, inventive retelling of their impromptu recording session."
