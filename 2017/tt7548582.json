But what about Brazil before it became Brazil? Who were the first habitants of this flank of the Americas? Where did they come from, how did they get here, and how did they live? With these questions and dozens more, a new generation of researchers is roaming the countryside, from the caves to the coastline. The number of archaeologists working sites in Brazil has soared. In search of a lost Brazil is a series that follows in their footsteps. In six episodes, we follow Brazilian scientists dedicated to exploring the country's deepest roots. The series' range extends from the Amazon rainforest to the desert-like backlands of the sertão, from the geoglyphs of Acre to the painted caverns of the Serra da Capivara National Park. At each dig, new relics are turning up while old ones are being re-examined. The Brazil emerging from these expeditions is in constant transformation, but already has challenged some of the cherished myths and received wisdom about this patch of the New World. Never has the past had a more promising future in Brazil.",
