It boasts over 5,000 years of history, yet in North America many Westerners today hear Chinese food and immediately picture overly sweet and sticky red sauces and over-fried globs of dough. Inspired by the discovery that the 2,500 year old philosopher Confucius was in fact a 'gourmand', classically trained celebrity chef Christine Cushing questions what Chinese cuisine really is and is North America eating it. Is Chinese food Chinese cuisine? Is North American 'Chinese' even Chinese? Are fortune cookies, chop suey and egg foo yung? Christine has long been fascinated by how a cuisine is transported from country to country as a culture's biggest ambassador and by the power of sharing food. Christine is a life-long student of culture and in Confucius Was a Foodie she takes viewers along as she explores the beginnings, the today and the future of Chinese cuisine in North America. Surprisingly, at every turn Christine discovers how much she and Confucius have in common when it comes to food! Christine connects with traditional Chinese chefs and various experts who will act as her guides and mentors as she discovers how Chinese cuisine is flourishing in North America despite misunderstandings and misconceptions. Her adventure begins as she travels to the west coast to explore the beginnings of Chinese cuisine in North America and to the east coast to see how it has evolved and is celebrated.",
