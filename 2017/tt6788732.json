When three women lose their loved ones at the same time, they band together and help each other get through the pain and jointly raise a child. The first \"sister\" is Kang Ha Ri (Kim Joo Hyun), who has a super personality that's probably a bit too bright for her profession. She is a part-timer, who works at a stationary store and nail shop. The second \"sister\" is Min Deul Re (Jang Seo Hee). She was once a popular actress. But the industry is brutal and the rule is simple: for the vast majority of actors and actresses, youth gone equals career gone. Now, she's just a has-been. The third \"sister\" is Kim Eun Hyang (Oh Yoon Ah), who is chic and elegant. She once worked as a secretary at a huge firm. However, now she focuses entirely on raising her daughter. Together, these three focus on helping each other through tough times and face everything life throws their way. Looking for a way to heal, they bring some joy into their life by caring for a young girl together. Joining the cast is also Seol Ki Chan (Lee Ji Hoon from Go Ho's Starry Night), a man who grew up in an orphanage and Yang Dal Hee (Kim Da Som, aka Dasom from SISTAR), a charming and intelligent girl who also seems to lie quite a bit and hates being poor. Can the band of sisters cope with all that is coming their way via sisterhood, or is life a little more difficult than simply \"fighting?\" Also known as \"Unni is Alive\" and \"Sister is Alive,\" Band of Sisters is directed by Choi Hyeong Hun, who fans will remember for his work on Second to Last Love. The drama is written by Kim Sun Ok (Temptation of an Angel), who is reuniting with her Temptation of Wife star Jang Seo Hee.
