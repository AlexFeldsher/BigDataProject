They studied, fell in love, partied - Since then a lot of things have changed. But they kept two habits of their happy youth: to call each other by student's nicknames and to drink the punch of their own invention \"Fox's Smile\" on Halloween. Preparing for an annual meeting with old friends, the main character Tatyana (nicknamed Bell) couldn't assume that this time nostalgic drinking of traditional student's drink will lead to murder. Untangling a knot of long-term passions and offenses, Tatyana will find out that their student's brotherhood became illusion long ago. Will the former friends manage to break off a chain of mutual treacheries? And who among eight kompanyeros is the carrier of false and seductive \"fox's smile\" indeed?",
