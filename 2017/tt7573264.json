            "«_Hvor er Thea?_ (qv)» «Where's Thea?» is a mystery web series following Liv, whose roommate Thea has gone missing without a trace in Oslo. When the police closes the case after a few weeks, Liv takes it upon herself to find her best friend, documenting her investigation and publishing it as video clips on her blog. But nothing about Thea is what it seems, and before long Liv realizes how little she actually knows about the person she feels the closest to, and how much of what she thought she knew is flat out wrong, or a lie. The biggest question seems not to be where Thea is, but who she is."
