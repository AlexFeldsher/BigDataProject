Each episode invites audiences to look closer into a suburb of the city and offers a secret slice of life from that pocket. The second season covers four suburbs. Aro Valley has a political edge. Set on the night of the 2017 General Election, it follows the lives of two middle class hippie couples, both with big secrets. Mt. Cook champions female storytelling (all female characters, female writers, and a female director). Rongotai, set over six years, is both our 'San Junipero' and the gay love story of our times (sorry Moonlight). Happy Valley reveals where witches in Wellington are born and bred.",
