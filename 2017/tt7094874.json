She is a doctor who believes only in modern medicine. Whirlwind of destiny awaits them as they delve deeper into each others lives.::FighterBoyZ",
            "In Joseon, Heo Im is one of the best acupuncturists and popular among the poor masses. However, as his birth denies him larger recognition from the ruling classes, he makes securing his status a priority and spends his evenings attending rich people in secret trying to make as much money and connections as he can. When he's finally called upon to act as a royal doctor, he rushes to the palace leaving behind a poor patient untreated. However, when he's about to treat the king, something goes wrong and he ends up fleeing chased by royal guards. Wounded and about to die, he instead wakes up alive and well in modern Seoul. There he meets Choi Yeon Kyung, a surgeon in a modern hospital who has a hard time connecting with her patients, is distrustful of traditional medicine and, unlike him, ranks saving lives above money. Their different methods and out views will lead them to clash initially, but they'll soon discover there's much they can learn from each other.::Dama del Puente"
