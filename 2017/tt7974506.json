        "plot outline": "An 8-part travel lifestyle series exploring sustainable tourism through luxury camping or \"glamping\" in exotic places across Asia. In each episode, we are led on these escapades by pairs of glampers from diverse backgrounds. They pursue exciting adventures in locations such as Mongolia, Cambodia, China, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Turkey while experiencing back-to-nature living. The series features fascinating glamping sites from mobile yurts to floating tents, in settings ranging from lush jungles and arid deserts, to tropical beaches and ancient ruins. In each episode, the glampers find out about the inspiration and philosophy behind each glamping style. To delve into the culture of each place, they engage in hands-on activities with the locals. Over the course of their journeys, they also learn how eco-tourism and glamping are helping local communities.",
