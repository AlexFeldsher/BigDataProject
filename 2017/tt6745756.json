But Angela is sure she has been deprived of the vital thing: her father's love. She is suspicious of him to be accessory to her mother's death, and she sees him as a menace to Dima, her fiancée. When Dima gets lost just before their marriage ceremony, Angela is sure her father has everything to do about it. She steals secret documents and gives them away to the police. The girl is aware her father is never going to forgive her and asks for shelter under witness protection program. But as soon as she finds herself in a provincial town, with a new passport and with no means of support, Angela finds out, horrified, that there has never been any witness protection program at all. The girl has just been used in someone's smart game, and it is definitely not her father who rules it all.",
