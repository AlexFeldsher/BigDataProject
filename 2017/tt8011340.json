        "plot outline": "Videostroj, in cooperation with the leading Slovenian POP TV, produced one of the most popular reality shows in Slovenia - The Farm. The untouched nature, the fame and hefty rewards were a great motivation for this unusual story that had gathered 18 contestants. The farm is located in the Slovenian Prekmurje region. Videostroj undertook a pretty heavy task to build the infrastructure in the Idyllic Slovenian estate that brought the competitors and the audience some 100 years back in time. In the record-breaking time, Videostroj production built an entire complex of new buildings and facilities, which aimed to demonstrate life on the estate without electricity, water and other benefits to which everyone is accustomed. The contestants were facing both the advantages and disadvantages of the former busy way of life. Rare and long-lost crafts, tools from the past, the old watermill and the ancient stove, old recipes and folks' tradition were just a part of the concept visioned by our creative team that put the contestants into life's greatest challenges. Both the audience and the competitors were taken to an emotional journey through the true values that are forgotten today, to show that with their own efforts, they can discover their possibilities, virtues and flaws. A step further was taken in the new season, : the estate had the biggest Arena so far, where competitors were faced with hard demands every week, challenging their strengths and choosing between the three types of duel: knowledge, skills and power. The set of completely new contest games was just a part of Videostroj's production effort, aiming to give the audience another unforgettable television experience that visually shifted the boundaries of the reality format.",
