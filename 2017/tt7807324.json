            "Timeout is the coming-of-age story of a 30-something married couple through the medium of an early, for lack of a better phrase, mid-life crisis. Rahul and Radha have been together for 7 years and married for 3 of them. She's the alpha, he's the permanently designated driver. And coasting along the lines of this status quo, they've reached a phase where they've just sunk all their savings into their first house and are now having the most regimented sex in the universe in order to have a baby. All of this is because Radha - who's from the Fire and Ice generation and has the t-shirt to prove it - wants to live by the numbers now. And the next step after 'owning a house' is to 'have a baby'. Rahul, however, suddenly has a meltdown precipitated by several factors - work, finances, discovering his dad's 10-year old affair. The last straw is the positive pregnancy test he discovers in the loo. This becomes the flashpoint for a series of events encompassing fights, breaks, potential affairs past and present and, eventually, a separation while they figure out their lives and, more importantly, themselves. This dysfunctional, emotional and ultimately poignant ride that the couple go on is bolstered by a supporting cast of characters that include their old best friends (married with twins, hence losing it) and new best friends (new boho upstairs neighbours, not a couple and from the generation they're trying to emulate). Ultimately, this is a story about that in-between age when you're not too young, not too old and just not as sorted as thought you would be. It's about discovering yourself and saving each other."
