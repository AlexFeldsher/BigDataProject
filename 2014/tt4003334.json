Because of their katorpehan, all men in Tupe's family remain a bachelor. The same goes for Tupe who, despite being the perfect gentleman, cannot make his move to win the heart of his muse: the gorgeous, God's gift to mankind, Monique Salcedo (Alice Dixson). Hoping to \"break the curse\" like him is his nephew from Croatia, Hanley Kubrick (Mark Neumann). Despite spending most of his teenage years in the US (Croatia not US), he is very shy around girls. And while Hanley stays here in the country, Tupe must help him overcome his katorpehan so that both of them can break away from their curse. Stakes get higher as Tupe's love-of-his-life, Monique, returns to the Philippines to try her luck on something she has never been successful before - love. While this gives Tupe another shot at romance, things will not be easier as his number one bully, Peter 'Mr. Big' Malaqui (Wendell Ramos), also returns to terrorize him once again. Fortunately, he/Tupe finds comfort in Luzvinda 'Luz' Mabuti (Gelli de Belen), his best friend and forever confidante who also secretly has feelings for him. Will Tupe win Monique's heart? Is he the long overdue romance destined for Monique? And what about Luz? Will she ever be able to confess her feelings for Tupe? Who will end up victorious in this comic story of failed attempts on love and romance?",
