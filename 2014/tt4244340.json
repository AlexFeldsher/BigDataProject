Each week, great American companies in different industries are featured and profiled. From aerospace, to deep sea, to motorsports, to our own military, Titan and his team of manufacturing experts show how we as Americans can still out-compete the rest of the world - all while showcasing advanced machining, technology and the greatest workforce on the planet, the American workforce. Each episode of TITAN will expose the compassionate, humanitarian side of Titan Gilroy. Titan has not forgotten where he has come from. Having overcome huge obstacles in his own life, Titan is passionate about helping others do the same. Watch as Titan uses his platform and journeys across our great nation, spreading his message of hope. A homeless women's shelter, his old prison, a youth correctional camp and an innovative high school all learn firsthand what it truly means to be American Built. American manufacturing was once a great symbol of our freedom. An industry that allowed us to control our own destiny, to produce our own goods, and employ our own people. It is time that we stand up and fight for that right once again. It is time that we fight for our jobs and fight for our workers. Join with us as we Fight for America.\"",

            "\"In the first season of TITAN American Built, Titan pulls back the curtains to reveal American manufacturing like its never been seen before. Each week, great American companies in different industries are featured and profiled. From aerospace, to deep sea, to motorsports, to our own military, Titan and his team of manufacturing experts show how we as Americans can still out-compete the rest of the world - all while showcasing advanced machining, technology and the greatest workforce on the planet, the American workforce. Each episode of TITAN will expose the compassionate, humanitarian side of Titan Gilroy. Titan has not forgotten where he has come from. Having overcome huge obstacles in his own life, Titan is passionate about helping others do the same. Watch as Titan uses his platform and journeys across our great nation, spreading his message of hope. A homeless women's shelter, his old prison, a youth correctional camp and an innovative high school all learn firsthand what it truly means to be American Built. American manufacturing was once a great symbol of our freedom. An industry that allowed us to control our own destiny, to produce our own goods, and employ our own people. It is time that we stand up and fight for that right once again. It is time that we fight for our jobs and fight for our workers. Join with us as we Fight for America.\""
