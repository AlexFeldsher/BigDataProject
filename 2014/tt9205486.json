Gloria (Leonora Okine) marries Dr. Vincent (Alex Ekubo) in a bid to appease her father, who is unhappy because of her total lack of interest in becoming a doctor and inheriting his hospital. The tale, however, takes a new twist when the couple runs over a stranger after their wedding reception. In the stranger's possession is a laptop bag containing more than just a laptop. This discovery sets the newlyweds on a journey of deception, greed and murder, as they battle with forces determined to tear them apart and destroy the future they once held dear. All is not as rosy as it seems in the Coker household, as dark secrets begin to emerge pointing to the grave realization that they may have both said \"I do\" to a complete stranger.",
