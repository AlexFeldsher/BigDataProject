            "For Amerikologys third season, Luis Oliva heads off to explore a country very much on the move, with a blossoming economy, yet glaringly-obvious social inequalities: Brazil. Host of the biggest social forums on the planet, bursting with innovative and progressive ideas, the country still nonetheless has 45 million citizens living below the poverty line. But grassroots work is already well underway throughout Brazil: from Rio de Janeiro to Sao Paulo, to Salvador and Porto Alegre. A colossal challenge has been taken up by courageous people who put the interests of their fellow-citizens at the center of their commitment. An inspiring undertaking that deserves to be reported. Work worthy of Amerikology."
