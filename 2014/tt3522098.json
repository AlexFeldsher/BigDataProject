The show follows their struggle to establish a small business, match their clients, and manage their accidental receptionist, the sweet and naive Cammie. Vern and Charna believe they have what it takes to find true love for all the unloveable bastards in the world. Inspired by their love or reality TV and Vern's one [possibly*] successful match, the duo transformed their living room into a working office and embarked on their new business venture, Don't Die Alone, LLC. At the core of Match Makers is the relationship between Charna and Vern, who seem very different on the surface, but have the same twisted core. Vern's dry pessimism is no threat to Charna's inner peace, but Charna's blithe optimism triggers Vern's rage blackouts. Cammie, for her part, is easily confused and just wants every day to be a good day!",
