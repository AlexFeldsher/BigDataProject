Before then it was summers and holidays. Before that, their mothers just stuck them in a playpen and hoped they would like each other. It worked. With a college education under their belts, the pact was in motion- to move to New York and be each other's live-in support system. Being that they both always dreamed of an acting career, this seemed like the absolute perfect life plan. But surprisingly, these two very, very different ladies- through the eyes of the industry - are quite the same. Audrey is like a tall glass of water, with the temperament of one, too. Corinne is a box of fireworks sitting dangerously close to a rapidly approaching fire. Dumbfounded as they are, they keep running into each other at auditions. But that's okay, you just get home and call your best friend to vent about it. Wait, hold on a second. That person is your best friend, and you live with them now. Whoops. And that's what this show is about- Audrey and Corinne, desperately trying to balance this newfound jealousy and their lifelong friendship, the occasional or more than occasional sabotage, relationships or lack thereof, and the overall lingering black cloud of uncertainty- the mascot of feelings for actors in their twenties. Especially for the ones that had no idea it was coming.",
