            "In our modern, ever-changing world, there are still mysteries and secrets hidden in plain sight closer than we think. For instance, can our hands unveil secrets concerning our precious health, our complex personalities or even indicate our longevity? Furthermore, shocking as it may seem, could a staggering thirty percent of illegitimacy be nothing but an insubstantial fabrication, or could it be, indeed, a reality? Surprisingly, do we really know how breasts--the universally potent symbols of fertility, sex and nurture--work? In this thought-provoking documentary series, each episode will unveil unexpected secrets on things easily taken for granted.::Nick Riganas"

            "Palm-reading doctors, the evolutionary benefits of cheating, and toxic breasts Tales of the Unexpected is an exciting new series of documentaries that shines its light into some of the stranger corners of science.Tales Of The Unexpected is a new strand of provocative, confronting and thoroughly entertaining science documentaries. Each episode reveals a fascinating, sometimes awkward, and frequently unsettling world where peculiar ideas are put to the test. Come with us to where nothing is quite as it seems, where diseases are diagnosed by palm-readers, where paternity uncertainty drives the mating game, and where breasts are a toxic health hazard.Episode 1 - The Secret Life of BreastsLaying breasts bare in the name of science.New science is revealing breasts in a way that weve never seen them before. For years weve been seeking perfection. Gradually we are beginning to understand the wondrous biochemistry and evolution of the breast. But now some scientists believe breasts may be a hidden toxic waste ground, living time-bombs that might endanger not only their owners but also those who suckle at them. Putting actual breast tissue - and breast milk - to the test we investigate if these wonderful life-giving organs are under threat from the modern world, and, if so, what we can do to save them.Episode 2 Secrets of The HandThe real science of palm reading.For thousands of years, in fairgrounds and temples, palm readers have claimed our hands encode valuable information. Is this just superstition? Or is there, buried beneath the theatre and the cliches, a core of solid scientific evidence for palm-readings predictive powers? Can our hands really tell us anything about our past, our present, or our future? For the first time on television, palm-reading is put to the test. Episode 3 Whos Your Daddy?Now theres nowhere to hide your genes.One in three children, claim many tabloids, may not be biologically related to the man they call Dad. Could this really be true? This program conducts the first ever purpose-designed paternity poll, asking some truly awkward questions. Comparing rates of paternity uncertainty in Australia and the Untied States, we ask what is the real rate of non-paternity, and might there be biological survival benefits for children born outside marriage? Following parents and children as they seek to uncover the truth, we discover how, today, theres nowhere to hide your genes."
