        "synopsis": [
            "The Ghostcircle team are made of Psychic Mediums, even the crew, and they all have the ability to communicate with spiritual beings or ghosts that are present in the locations that they investigate. Ghostcircle films each show with out any scripts, or story boarding. In each episode they show in a unique format that there are presences around us, some trapped, some visiting, some helping and others blocking. The team effort gains information with empirical proof through experimentation of spiritual presences through gathering Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVPs), and by doing psychic experiments using a physical energy called \"photoplasm\", which allows the presences to create voices, or move objects like flowers; or, even move other things like ping pong balls. The team do these psychic live experiments with members of the public in an unscripted format giving them a unique experience. Ghostcircle has done these experiments with thousands of people and filmed hundreds of interviews.\nHow is this being done?\nWe are putting forward empirical evidence. Evidence based on science using observation, experiment, and experience. We can REPEAT all our phenomenon captured. I emphasise the word repeat as this makes it not paranormal, but normal natural phenomenon.\nIs it Physical mediumship?\nI am experimenting with modern physical mediumship in light, there is no darkness when I do my circles. People can see, sense, feel, and touch physical phenomena in a red and blue lighted room. White light destroys the energy. I do not sit in a cabinet but use one to store energy.\nWhat results have found?\nWe have found that next existence of life after this life is based on a spirit body living in another dimension of space. Our personality survives death as does our consciousness and mind, but our physical shell is left behind.\nAre you a scientist?\nI am not a qualified scientist but I do follow scientific empirical procedures, the same procedures that a recognised qualified scientists does. I am observing, experimenting and have plenty of experience in this field. From this point of view I am just trying to put forward an objective approach to a subject that so little is known about. Indeed, in my opinion it is such an important science as many of the other sciences out there.\nWhat are your techniques?\nThe techniques we use are simple, using regular off the shelf technology to capture spirit presences on video film. No tricks, or mirrors, are used. The people in the videos are ordinary members of the public chosen by others to be filmed during a physical circle. The episodes are done to make them entertaining, and show what can be done with mediumship and physical mediumship."
