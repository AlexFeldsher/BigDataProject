These predators often have one key asset that they rely on for their survival, one trump card that gives them a hunting advantage: from deadly venom, to a powerful killing water jet, razor-sharp talons, lightning speed or a big mouth. Yet, while the predator is perfectly adapted for the hunt, the prey is perfectly adapted to survive. They often escape, despite the hunter's sophisticated weaponry.    "

        "plot outline": "There is no greater predatory testing ground than the African Savannah. Its greatest hunters: Lion, crocodile, leopard, hyena, and cheetah hunt day in and day out, using their killer machinery to turn epic hunts into successful kills. We score each predator on what it has to be successful: Size & Strength, Speed, Strategy, Teamwork, and Weapons give them a total out of 50. The crocodile has an 80% success rate on our predator scoreboard - but does this score on paper reflect its actual success on game day? The twist is that when it counts, these numbers get thrown out the window: Out in the wild anything can happen, even their killer machinery can't always guarantee success... This is a numbers game, and before these expert killers can get a meal they must fail first... A lioness gets flicked into the air by a buffalo; crocodiles are kicked in the head by stampeding wildebeest; a cheetah clean misses its target; hyenas fall at the hands of lions; and the wily leopard only just escapes a warthog's deadly tusks! The truth is: It's nit as easy as it looks for Africa's deadliest. These iconic predators aren't as successful as you think, and at the end of the day it's their killer determination that saves them. Failing is part of the deal, but to stop trying is the end of the road.",
