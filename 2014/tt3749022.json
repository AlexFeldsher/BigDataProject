            "Sergi Roca, owner of the twelve-Michelin-starred Cool Roca restaurant in Barcelona, is a world famous chef who has it all. Pepe Leal, on the other hand, is the down-on-his-luck owner of El Chiringuito de Pepe, a beach-side greasy spoon in the town of Peñiscola. What could these two possibly have in common?As it turns out, Sergi's father confesses during an illness that his estranged childhood friend Pepe is in fact Sergi's real father, but knows nothing of it. Wanting to make up for stealing the Italian woman his former pal loved and for hiding the truth about their son, he asks Sergi to go to Peñiscola to revive the eatery, which has been in Pepe's family for generations.Puzzled and needing to know his true roots, Sergi moves to Peñiscola where he buys into the restaurant, claiming that he wants a new challenge, but without revealing to Pepe, or Pepe's son Vicente, the real reason. At the same time, Sergi's ex-wife sends their son Manu to spend time with him there -- a boy Sergi barely knows.The series follows Sergi as he works to turn the business around and, in the process, discovers his family."
