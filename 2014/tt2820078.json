Unfortunately, the party's chief political wonk strongarms Daniel into first finding a candidate and running a election campaign in a hopeless riding before he can resign.

            "For five years, Daniel Addison, who has a Ph.D. in English, has been the head speech writer for George Quimby, Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Parliament. Quimby has been in this role for three successive minority governments in the past six years, and another election has just been called. Despite being a political junkie, Daniel decides to leave this job, largely to get away from two colleagues, Bradley Stanton, Quimby's tyrannical chief of staff, and Rachel Bronwin, a party strategist and Daniel's girlfriend who he caught cheating on him. Daniel chooses as his next job university professor. Bradley and Rachel convince Daniel to do one last job for the party as he moves onto this new life, namely find a candidate to run in the riding of Cumberland-Prescott, as safe a seat for the existing governing party as there is, and manage that candidate's campaign. This job should be stress free as it would require no work to manage the campaign for a candidate sure to lose. After some missteps, Daniel is finally able to convince someone to run, namely Engineering professor Angus McLintock, who is Daniel's new landlord. Angus is well aware of the situation, and only agrees to do Daniel this favor on the guarantee that he has to do no campaigning whatsoever, including making no public appearances. In turn, Daniel has to take over one of Angus' compulsory classes, English for first year Engineering students, as miserable a job within the university if only because English and budding engineers do not mix. This last job for the party is not as easy as Daniel expects, as he has to deal with some enthusiastic people who want to work on the campaign, including Muriel Parkinson, the losing candidate in the riding for the party for those three previous elections. In addition, Norm Fontana, a reporter with the Ottawa Tribune, decides to write an article about Angus the politician, he who will try to track down Angus by whatever means despite Daniel's best efforts to hide Angus from the public. But what may be most difficult for Daniel is lying to Lindsay Dewar, Muriel's granddaughter, who is also working on the campaign and for who Daniel is falling.::Huggo"
