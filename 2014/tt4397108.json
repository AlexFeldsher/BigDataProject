This series highlights the intoxicating highs and soul-crushing lows of chasing illogical dreams in the most unlikely of places, amidst the company of brothers and enemies, courage and doubt. Fran, the self-destructive writer/director, has a talent for losing friends, breaking up independent film productions with ridiculous reshoots, and writing scripts full of drunken beauty. Susie, the frustrated director of photography, has a tremendous eye for shots, a knack for keeping a production rolling, and a temper that has resulted in film festival director restraining orders and assault charges. Pat is a business-savvy independent producer with no money and a broken-heart who isn't afraid to ask, beg, and plead to hold the crew together; his only response to his wife's divorce request is to dive headfirst into the pursuit of the only other dream he knows - filmmaking. Getting the crew back together is going to be difficult enough. Making this movie might just kill them all.",
