        "plot outline": "An uptight domineering brother works hard to take care of himself and his ungrateful twin brother. Using the passing of their mother and the old fashioned method, Jewish guilt, they find ways to manipulate each other into helping the other. Bernard and Louis are complete opposites and view the world through different eyes. A typical day in the conflicting lives of the twins, while one works and the other makes excuses and lusts after Bernard's confidant and next door neighbor Crissy, who is always an eyeview away from Louis's balcony. Meanwhile, Bernard is working for Johnny the Jewish \"Authentic\" Mexican restaurant owner, handing out promotional flyers and flirting with random attractive men. On a daily basis, Bernard comes over to Louis's apartment to drop off groceries, where occasionally he finds Gretchen living off his brother, who is indirectly living off of what Bernard provides. That only infuriates him more. The heart of their constant feuding lies at their mother's passing the Jewish guilt, which ultimately keeps them bonded as brothers.",
