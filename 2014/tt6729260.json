        "plot outline": "\"Zyara\" is an Arabic word that means \"Visit\" in English. Zyara is a documentary web-series of three to five minute videos. It depicts intimate portraits of various individuals sharing their hopes and dreams, their love stories, fears, family albums, and their most memorable experiences. Zyara promotes oneness by exploring universal human emotions, away from religion, politics or anything that separates human beings. Zyara highlights what unites us in a poetic impressionistic visual treatment, representing the unique world of each individual, through a deep cinematic exploration of the 3 main elements that represent us: \"the Body\", \"the Home\" and \"the Light.\" The super-imposed layers of flesh, space and light bring to life the stories told by every human being generous enough to invite us for a \"Zyara\" and share their story. Zyara is a borderless and limitless web-series, it is addressed to every human being on this planet open enough to receive it. It is an act of love towards Mankind and every emotion that unites them, with only one rule: authenticity in art as in life.",
