His resignation to the Mexican Embassy in India, after 25 years of diplomatic service, marks the beginning of a new chapter in the poets life, an era filled with political and intellectual activism, in which he displayed a vast journalistic and essayist work that established him as an international opinion leader. Armed with his language and words, Paz led a fight for democracy for which he was admired and criticized. Through his magazines Plural and Vuelta, he gave voice to young authors and opened the doors for dialogue and freedom of expression, in a belittled and censored country. His prolific pen gave birth to great works that won multiple awards and international recognition, culminating in 1990 with the prestigious Nobel Prize for Literature. A hundred years after his birth, Octavio Paz's voice still resonates in the thinking of Mexico and the world.",
