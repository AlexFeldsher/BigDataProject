All two aware of the shallow nature of the industry, she begins to feel the weight of the industry as younger and more naive girls begin to appear on the scene. Keen to keep the wolves from her door, she increasingly feels the need to explore other avenues of the industry that also rely on her good looks for success, tasking risks she would otherwise ignore. Her past a bit of a mystery, she has always felt alone in the world and has very few real friends she can count on, she feels the independence she has discovered through loneliness has only made her wiser and stronger than most other girls in her position. High on her morals, she progressively feels as though she is forced to turn a blind eye to the obscurity that goes on in the world around her. Constantly torn between her morals and her judgment, the pressure begins to force her into a downward spiral where she feels she is being made to choose between right and wrong. She isn't as innocent as she looks and it's only a matter of time before the very wolves she tries to keep from her door become the sheep she chooses to reap and everyone she touches, in the end becomes tainted by her own demise.",
