            "Na Ae-Ra married Cha Jung-Woo when they were young and idealistic: she wanted to be a housewife and mother and he wanted to do well in business. However, their dreams diverge when Jung-Woo suddenly invests in his own business without consulting Ae-Ra; the resulting debt he incurs forces her to work multiple jobs to keep them afloat. After a couple years of Jung-Woo's continued stagnant work prospects, they divorce, each believing the other is more at fault: she believing he broke his promises to take care of her, and he believing she was unsupportive of his dreams and angry at her resulting harsh treatment of him leading up to the divorce. Fast forward some years and it turns out Jung-Woo became a huge, profitable success in business and is living the high life, whereas Ae-Ra is still paying off debts from their marriage. They meet again under turbulent circumstances and their acrimonious feelings resurface, causing Ae-Ra to vow revenge against him for all the suffering she endured, and Jung-Woo to strive to expose her as the conniving gold-digger he believes her to be."
