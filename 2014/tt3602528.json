The five Israelis-all ordinary, undistinguished people, awash in their daily routines-are stunned to find themselves implicated in the daring kidnapping.

At first these so-called heroes believe the affair will fade away. But they soon discover, to their astonishment, that official Israel, the state that is supposed to protect them, as well as Mossad itself, are denying all involvement and view them as suspects. Instead of helping them, the authorities persecute, investigate, and point fingers. Even among their loved ones, doubt starts to nag. Could they have been involved?",
