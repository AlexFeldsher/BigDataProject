            "Undercover High is a half-hour, hidden camera show for teens, that takes the world of prank television and brings it to the one place that kids will never expect it their own high school!High school is ripe with pranking potential classrooms, cafeterias, football fields, auditoriums, libraries, gymnasiumseven the principals office and in this case the pranksters are the unlikeliest of culprits the teachers, principals and school staff.Just when students think that theyve settled in for a typical, mundane day of reading, writing and arithmetic, suddenly their school has turned into one large practical joke with actors, along with the school faculty, ready to pull off the ultimate high school prank.At its heart, Undercover High is a comedy show, exploiting every facet of high school life for maximum laughs, featuring pranks that every kid (and adult who remembers high school) will remember in all its gut-splitting glory."
