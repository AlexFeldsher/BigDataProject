There are as many ways to break up as there are weeks in the year. It's not about the conversation, or the fall out, but just the moment you know. You may wait until later to actually cut them loose, but in that moment you know that this relationship is going to end. 52 ways to Break Up. When was the moment you first knew it was over?"
