            "Be invited into some very different No. 9s, where the ordinary and mundane rub shoulders with the extraordinary and macabre. From a grand country house where a game of 'sardines' leads to some chilling revelations in a wardrobe; to a very oddly haunted house; to a blood-soaked actor's dressing room in London's West End; to the flat of an apparently happy primary school teacher who becomes the victim of a good deed; these unpredictable tales feature high comedy and claustrophobic horror by turns.::BBC"

            "A series of six episodes that takes place in a different house every week, which are always No.9. These include a stately home where a sinister game of sardines is taking place, a flat above a shop where a friendly sort of man meets his polar opposite, a dressing room for a theatre holding a producing of the supposedly cursed Macbeth, an apartment where a group of friends discover a priceless relic and a modern house where a bungled burglary is happening. Each story contains elements of both comedy, and horror, in the style of an anthology series."
