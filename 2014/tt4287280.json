While some believe in continuing the town's frontier way of life, others feel the future of McCarthy depends on dragging itself into the modern age. Which way of life will reign supreme? It's tradition versus transformation. Built during the Gold Rush in 1900, McCarthy was once a vibrant and flourishing city. Today, with over 100 miles between the residents and the nearest law enforcement, only 42 people still brave the extreme conditions to live in this secluded, 'Old West' town. A place where young men go to prove themselves, and old outlaws go to die; home to bear hunters, gold miners, gun smiths, backwoods survivalists - those who choose to reside in this little known town are willing to risk their lives to live truly free. Each of the roughly four dozen residents of McCarthy is living this dangerous wilderness life for their own, very different, reasons. Neil Darish moved to McCarthy with dreams of restoring the small town to its former glory. After spending years buying property after property in downtown McCarthy, he plans to bring this frontier town into the 21st Century. On the opposite end of the spectrum are long-standing residents like Jeremy Keller who came to McCarthy hoping to escape the evils of modern day society, and will fight to protect 'the old way' at any cost. As diverse as the citizens of McCarthy are, they have one thing in common: everyone who ventures to this town is trying to run away from something. They are mavericks and trailblazers, risk takers and rabble rousers, all attempting to escape their past by surviving at the end of America. This is the story of our country's last true frontier town - on the Edge of Alaska.",

Neil Darish moved to McCarthy with dreams of restoring the small town to its former glory. After spending years buying property after property in downtown McCarthy, he plans to bring this frontier town into the 21st Century. On the opposite end of the spectrum are long-standing residents like Jeremy Keller who came to McCarthy hoping to escape the evils of modern day society, and will fight to protect 'the old way' at any cost. As diverse as the citizens of McCarthy are, they have one thing in common: everyone who ventures to this town is trying to run away from something. They are mavericks and trailblazers, risk takers and rabble rousers, all attempting to escape their past by surviving at the end of America. This is the story of our country's last true frontier town - on the _Edge of Alaska_ (qv)."
