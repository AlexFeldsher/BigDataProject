            "Spoilers: Spoiler textIn Fuyuki City, Japan, Rin Tsaka wakes up after having a dream about her last moment with her father Tokiomi. Once she arrives at school, she realizes she is early because the clocks in her home were set forward by an hour. She meets with other people at the school who arrived early, including Ayako Mitsuzuri, the head of the school's archery club; Sakura Mat, a new member of the archery club; Shinji Mat, Sakura's older brother; Taiga Fujimura, one of the schoolteachers; Issei Ryuudou, the student council president; and an unknown red-haired boy fixing a heater for Issei. After school, Rin performs a summoning ritual and summons a Servant of the Archer class, much to her displeasure, as she hoped to summon a Servant of the Saber class. Archer is initially dissatisfied with Rin, who uses one of her Command Seals to order Archer to listen to all of her orders. While the order is worded vaguely and therefore pointless, Archer admits that he now realizes her skill as a mage. The next day, Rin skips school and shows Archer around the city, revealing to him that she has no wish for the Holy Grail, only a desire to win. The following day, Rin senses a magical barrier being set up at school. As night falls, Rin attempts to destroy the barrier, but is then confronted by another Servant, identified as being of the Lancer class, who engages Archer in a sword-fight. As they battle, Archer correctly deduces that Lancer is in fact the ancient Irish hero Cú Chulainn. The battle is witnessed by a student, whom Lancer pursues and mortally wounds before fleeing. Finding the student's body, Rin identifies him as the same red-haired boy who was helping Issei, and decides to use magic to revive him. After leaving, Rin and Archer realize that Lancer's Master will sense that the student has survived and have Lancer finish the job. They head over to the suburbs to save the student, only to be attacked by another Servant, whom Rin identifies as belonging to the Saber class.Shiro Emiya is woken up by Sakura, a close friend of his who visits his home frequently. After having breakfast with her and Taiga, who is his legal guardian, he goes to school and fixes a heater for Issei, which is briefly observed by Rin. Issei remarks that Shiro never hesitates in helping people in need and warns him that he may be taken advantage of by inconsiderate people. While walking home from school, he encounters a silver-haired girl, who warns him to summon a Servant soon before vanishing. The next day, while helping Sakura with the dishes, Shiro notices a bruise on her hand and assumes that Shinji is beating her. At school, he learns from Mitsuzuri that Shinji has recently been acting more aggressively. He is then informed by other students of the murders of a family of four; while visiting the crime scene, Shiro recalls the time he was rescued by Kiritsugu Emiya in the aftermath of a devastating fire that occurred ten years ago, later being adopted by him and learning that he is a mage. He then notes how he had devoted his life to Kiritsugu's ideal of becoming a hero of justice. The following day, he stays late at school and confronts Shinji about Sakura's injury, but Shinji denies any involvement before asking Shiro to clean the school's kyd dojo, which he decides to do. After finishing, he witnesses the fight between Archer and Lancer, the latter of whom notices him. Fleeing inside the school, Shir is suddenly cornered by Lancer, who stabs him in the heart and flees. Shior nearly dies from his wound, but is revived by Rin, who then quickly leaves before he can recognize her. Returning home, he is attacked by Lancer again and forced to flee into the backyard shed. There, he accidentally summons Saber, who wards off Lancer after a brief battle. After identifying Shiro as her Master, Saber engages Archer in a sword-fight, forcing Shir to use one of his Command Seals to stop her assault. The two are then greeted by a calm Rin.Back in Shiro's home, Rin explains that he had been chosen as a Master for the Holy Grail War, then explains the basics behind it. When Shiro is unable to comprehend the situation, Rin decides to take him to see Kirei Kotomine, a priest who is her legal guardian and also the overseer of the Holy Grail War. When they arrive at Kirei's church and meet up with him, Shiro learns that once someone is chosen to fight as a Master, their responsibilities are unavoidable. He then learns about the Holy Grail and the purpose of the Holy Grail War. Then, Shiro learns that there were four Holy Grail Wars before the current one, with the latest one taking place ten years ago. When he asks what happens if a Master with dark intentions wins the Grail, Kirei replies that there can be no action taken against the victor, and that the only way he could prevent such a Master from winning is to win it himself. He then adds that at the conclusion of the previous Holy Grail War, a Master with dark intentions touched the Grail, resulting in the fire that Shiro survived, a revelation which horrifies Shiro. Kirei then reveals that before the unworthy Master appeared, another Master actually won the Grail and held it, but because the Grail hadn't fully materialized at the time due to this Master refusing to fight, it deemed him unworthy to hold it. As a result of all the information he had just learned, Shiro finally accepts his responsibilities as a Master. Regrouping with Saber outside of the church, Shiro declares that he will be her Master, and they agree to fight in the Holy Grail War together. Later, Archer informs Rin that since Shir is now a proper Master, they should attack, but she responds that she still has a debt to pay him and instead decides to let him and Saber return home. Moments later, they are confronted by the same silver-haired girl Shir briefly met earlier, who is revealed to also be a Master, and her Servant, which Rin identifies as belonging to the Berserker class.The girl introduces herself as Illyasviel von Einzbern, a name which Rin recognizes. She and Archer evaluate Berserker's strength before Archer moves to a farther position so he could attack Berserker from a distance. Berserker then attacks Saber, who is overwhelmed by his brute strength and agility. Archer and Rin try to provide support for Saber, but Berserker constantly winds up being unaffected by their strikes. When the fight moves away into the suburbs, Rin orders Shiro to run, but he remembers his agreement with Saber and instead follows them. As the fight progresses, Kirei is visited by a mysterious blond, red-eyed man, and they both claim their intentions to witnessing the Holy Grail's materialization in its fullest detail. The fight then moves through a forest and into a local cemetery, while Rin tries to kill Illyasviel, but she counters with several bird-shaped homunculi. Rin is rescued by Archer's attacks. While running back to Saber, Rin runs into Shir, and they watch as Saber kills Berserker, which then suddenly resurrects and regenerates itself, one of its Noble Phantasms. Archer projects and fires a sword-shaped arrow at Berserker, which engulfs it in a massive explosion, but it fails to affect it. Illyasviel, impressed by Archer's strength, withdraws Berserker and flees. Seconds later, Shir suddenly begins vomiting blood.Shiro wakes up in his home, uninjured and Rin sitting at his side. She leaves, but not before telling him that when they meet next time, it will be as enemies. Shiro then finds Saber in the dojo, and she reveals that he has self-healing magical capabilities, explaining the absence of the injuries he sustained in the battle with Berserker. Saber then explains the mechanics of the seven Servants and the advantages and disadvantages of knowing a Servant's real-life identity, then asks that she not reveal her identity to him since he is an inexperienced mage, a request he approves of. Shir and Saber then go to school to deliver lunch to the archery club. There, Saber explores the school and has a tense encounter with Sichiro Kuzuki, one of the instructors, before they are interrupted by Shir. Later that day, while still at the school, Shiro is approached by Mitsuzuri, who asks if he will rejoin the archery club before noting he has never smiled in his life. While walking home with Saber, Sakura, and Taiga, he explains that Saber is a friend of Kiritsugu's and will be staying with him temporarily. Sakura is seemingly horrified by the idea, but Taiga approves under the condition that she stay in the home as well during that time. Elsewhere, Rin and Archer investigate an office building purportedly having a gas leak and find it is actually the work of another Servant who is absorbing the life force of the employees inside. They theorize that the Servant responsible is of the Caster class and is likely at Ryuudou Temple. When Rin decides to pursue Caster, Archer notes that she is ignoring Shir, who she could easily kill to get him out of her way, and asks what will happen if Shir approaches her again.Five years ago, Kiritsugu tells Shir about how he once wished to become a hero of justice. Shiro promises him that he will fulfill that dream for him, after which Kiritsugu passes away in satisfaction. In the present day, Shir goes to school alone, despite Saber's insistence that she accompany him. At school, he learns from Issei that Mitsuzuri had gone missing the previous day and that she was last seen arguing with Shinji, who is currently absent, with no one able to contact him. As school ends for the day, Shiro is confronted by Rin, who attacks him despite his protests. After a brief chase, Rin eventually corners him and tries threatening him into handing over his remaining Command Seals, but before she could carry out her threat, they hear a scream. Shiro investigates and finds an unconscious student who had most of her mana absorbed. As Rin treats the student, Shiro is wounded after shielding her from an incoming attack by an unknown female Servant. He then pursues the Servant into the nearby woods, where he is restrained and nearly killed by her, only to be saved by Rin, whose appearance prompts the Servant to flee. Rin treats Shiro's wounds and decides to call off their fight, taking him to her house to evaluate the situation. Then, the two agree to have a truce and track down the Servant and her Master together. The following night, Rin learns of Shiro's magical training, which she is outraged by, as Kiritsugu didn't adhere to the tradition of magecraft by prioritizing himself as a father rather than a mage.While walking back home, Shir senses Archer following him. After a brief conversation, Archer responds that he doesn't have any interest for the Holy Grail. He then explains that Servants are no more than mere tools for their Masters and reveals that he died with no unfulfilled dreams before disappearing. Returning home, Shiro learns from Taiga that Mitsuzuri was found alive without any visible injuries. He then meets up with Saber and tells her of the truce he made with Rin, which she approves of. The next day, at the school library, Shiro and Rin discuss on how to locate the female Servant's Master before Shiro senses a sigil in one of the bookshelves, which Rin disables. They then explore the school grounds and disable other sigils, which they realize were set up for strengthening the magical barrier placed over the school. While preparing to head home, Shir is confronted by Shinji, who reveals himself as the female Servant's Master and also the one who set up the barrier, also exposing the entire Mat family as a former clan of mages. Shinji then tries to convince Shiro to form an alliance, but he turns the offer down, although he promises to keep quiet about their conversation. The following night, Shiro wakes up and finds himself restrained at Ryuudou Temple. He is approached by a hooded female Servant, identified as Caster, who admits responsibility for a purported series of gas leaks all over Fuyuki, enraging Shir. Caster then expresses her intention to remove Shiro's Command Seals and transplant them to her own Master, but before she could do so, Archer intervenes and prepares to engage Caster in battle. Meanwhile, Saber senses Shir's disappearance and heads to Ryuudou Temple, only to be faced by a second Servant, who identifies himself as an Assassin-class Servant and claims to be the Japanese swordsman Sasaki Kojiro. Then, he challenges Saber to a duel.Saber engages Assassin in battle after he threatens the safety of Shir, and is shocked to find that despite her advantages in strength and agility, she cannot break through his defenses. At Ryuudou Temple, Caster reveals that Assassin is her own Servant, as she is a mage as well. Archer claims that she broke the rules of the Holy Grail War and insults her tactics before engaging her in battle. After a while, Archer manages to critically wound Caster, prompting Assassin to finish his assault prematurely with his Noble Phantasm. When Caster asks Archer why he is not finishing her off, he responds that his main goal was Shiro's safety and he is not a believer in senseless slaughter. This causes Caster to compare Shiro and Archer, claiming that their ideals are so identical that they are \"the same\", before trying to ask them to join her, although both reject the offer. Archer then allows Caster to flee despite the fact that she will continue to kill innocent people. When Shir protests this decision, Archer counters that doing so will be instrumental in the defeats of not only her, but those of her Master and Berserker. Disgusted by Archer's willingness to allow collateral damage, Shir criticizes his ideals, and Archer defends them, citing that if Caster were to win the Holy Grail, the damage would extend far beyond Fuyuki. Unable to accept this, Shir tries going after Caster alone, but is slashed in the back by Archer. He staggers out of Ryuudou Temple and is tended to by Saber, who survived Assassin's Noble Phantasm. Archer continues his assault, but is distracted by Assassin, who is impressed by Saber's power and allows her and Shir to escape. At the dojo, after commenting on Archer's swordsmanship, Shir, now unwilling to lose to him again, asks Saber to teach him how to fight with a sword.After having a lesson with Saber on how to use a sword, Shir notices that he performed better than during his previous lesson. He notes to Saber that he is using Archer's techniques as a basis for his study, which seems to upset Saber. Arriving at school late, Shir is met by Shinji, who greets him ominously. During lunchtime, Rin reluctantly forces Shiro to eat with her at the school rooftop. She reveals that she learned about Archer's attack on him and was forced to use a Command Seal to prevent him from further attacking him. Shir asks about the Mat family being a bloodline of mages; Rin responds that while they are, their magical abilities died off with each generation. She then admits that she had recently found out Shinji was a Master, but relented in attacking him because he lacked experience in magic, and that as a result, there is another Master present in the school. Then, Shinji's Servant activates a second, much stronger magical barrier around the school, which absorbs the mana of everyone but Shiro and Rin. The two are attacked by skeletal beings called Golems, and Shiro summons Saber via Command Seal. Saber battles the Golems while he and Rin go to the school's first floor to disable the barrier. After dispatching several Golems, Saber faces off against Shinji's Servant, who is identified as being of the Rider class, and manages to stab her, but Rider is revealed to be an apparition created by Caster, who disappears. Meanwhile, Shiro and Rin find Shinji and the corpse of the real Rider, which dissolves, causing the barrier to dissipate. Shinji refuses to identify the Servant who killed Rider and flees the school. After Shir, Rin, and Saber assess the situation and deduce that Caster killed Rider, Rin notes Shiro's ability to recognize the conditions of the unconscious students and employees, and he replies that he was used to seeing dead bodies, which confuses Rin.Following the events at the school, Shiro allows Saber to sleep next to his room so she could prevent him from being taken by Caster again. Meanwhile, Shinji arrives at Kirei's church and pleads with him to offer him shelter and protection. However, when he finds out he was the first Master to lose his Servant, he blames the loss on Rider, yelling that she was useless as a Servant. Realizing Shinji still has a resolve to fight, Kirei tells him there is one additional Servant available for usage. After clearing Issei of being Caster's Master, Shiro encounters Rin, who is spying on the blond-haired, red-eyed man who visited Kirei at his church; the man had been observing the Mat home for some time. When the man leaves, Rin asks Shir about what would happen if someone were to be adopted by another family against his or her will, and forced to grow up in their care. While eating dinner, Taiga tells Saber about Shiro's childhood and Kiritsugu, commenting that they seemed to be polar opposites of each other due to their personalities, and also mentions Shiro's wish to become a hero of justice. When Saber asks him why he wanted to become a hero of justice, Shiro vaguely replies that it was because he looked up to them. However, while in his room alone, he concludes he only wanted to follow in Kiritsugu's footsteps, and then remembers Archer's words that his ideals were flawed.Rin wakes up after having a dream about how Archer became a Servant in the first place. She later discusses Shiro's reliability as an ally with Archer, who suggests Caster would be a more efficient partner for them, which upsets her. At school, Shiro notices Issei talking with Kuzuki and learns from him that Kuzuki lives at Ryuudou Temple with a mysterious woman who is believed to be his fiancée. Rin theorizes from the information that Kuzuki is Caster's Master and plans on confirming them by attacking Kuzuki with a non-lethal magical attack and observe his reaction. The following night, Shiro, Rin, and Saber set up their quarters at an abandoned gas station where Kuzuki usually passes by. When he arrives, Rin fires the magical attack on him, but he is unaffected and Caster arrives for assistance. An outraged Shir confronts Kuzuki and asks if he knew about Caster's attacks on innocent people; Kuzuki responds that he was unaware but did not care the slightest, revealing himself to be a former killer. Rin then attacks Caster as a distraction while Saber tries to strike Kuzuki, but Kuzuki uses magically-strengthened fists to subdue Saber and Rin, then brutalizes Shiro. In response, he summons Archer's dual swords and uses them to repel Kuzuki's attacks. When Saber and Rin regain consciousness, Kuzuki and Caster flee. Rin asks Shiro how he was able to summon weapons, and he reveals that while he specialized in strengthening magic, he first succeeded at using projection magic. Meanwhile, Shinji meets his new Servant, the blond-haired, red-eyed man, who dismisses his strategy to kill innocent people for their mana and reveals his plan to use the Holy Grail to kill most of the human population in the world.After the battle with Caster and Kuzuki, Shiro and Saber return home. Shiro claims he is fine so as not to worry Saber, but is clearly in pain and off-balance as a result of using projection magic. The next day, he goes to school and finds that Kuzuki is absent due to what is claimed to be an illness. After school, Shiro returns home, where Rin suddenly arrives unannounced. The two proceed to formulate a strategy to deal with Caster. However, their only viable plan is a full-frontal attack against Ryuudou Temple. While Rin and Saber agree it is their best shot, they fear that Caster might opt to destroy the entire temple if she is cornered. After dinner, Shir meets Rin in the courtyard, where she muses that Shir's house is more open and welcoming than her own, and that perhaps it is better that Shiro did not adopt the lifestyle of a true mage. She then tells Shiro that she became a mage because she personally enjoys studying magic, and asks him what his reasons for studying magic are. Shiro responds that he wants to use magic to help others, which frustrates Rin, who cites that it is not right for him to put the happiness of others above his own. She then tells Shiro that she will be staying at his house for the night. Later that night, Shiro returns to the shed to practice his magic. Saber comes in to check on him, and he tells her how Kiritsugu was a good man and how he wanted to be a hero like him. Archer then arrives and asks Shiro about his symptoms, knowing precisely the side-effects of using projection magic. He tells Shiro that the pain he is feeling is due to activating magic circuits that had long lay dormant. After repairing Shiro's magic circuits and noting that he once went through a similar experience, Archer warns him that his ideals are meaningless and doomed to fail, something Shiro denies.While returning home from a trip in the next town, Shiro, Rin, and Saber find themselves inside a magical barrier, and they are ambushed by Caster and several water Golems. Caster reveals she has taken Taiga hostage and threatens to kill her unless Shiro hands over his magical circuits to her. When Shiro refuses, Caster tells him that she knows about the fire that he survived ten years ago, then claims her knowledge of a method to summon the Holy Grail without any further fighting, which can only be accomplished by Saber's mana. Shiro allows Caster to take his Command Seals in order to rescue Taiga, but an ambivalent Saber engages Caster in battle. Shiro uses a Command Seal to stop Saber, allowing Caster to stab her in the heart with a dagger-like Noble Phantasm called \"Rule Breaker\", which takes Shiro's remaining Command Seals and gives Caster control over Saber. After releasing Taiga, Caster forces Saber to kill Rin, but Shiro is injured while taking the blow. Saber then resists against Caster's magic long enough for Shiro, Rin, and Taiga to escape with assistance from Archer. Regaining consciousness at Rin's house, Shiro finds a jewel. He recognizes it as the same one that had been used on him while Rin revived him after he was stabbed by Lancer during the first battle. Meanwhile, Caster arrives at Kirei's church and demands the location of the Lesser Grail, the vessel for the Holy Grail. When he refuses to disclose it, she has him attacked by Golems. Shiro finds Rin at the top of a skyscraper and tries offering his assistance. However, she tells him that without Saber as his Servant, there is no longer a reason for him to be involved in the Holy Grail War and leaves with Archer. As she leaves, Rin warns him to stay out of the war, otherwise he will die.Shiro returns home and reminisces about how Kiritsugu's ideals and the Fuyuki City fire ten years ago inspired him to become a hero of justice. Meanwhile, at Kirei's church, Caster visits a captive Saber, who is resisting magical torture. She is then confronted by Kuzuki, who learns that her last two attacks had been of her own free will and that she intends to use the church to obtain the Holy Grail's vessel. After waking up from a dream about Archer, Rin goes to Kirei's church with Archer and finds bloodstains. She concludes that Caster attacked Kirei but he somehow managed to survive. The two then confront Caster and Kuzuki, but when Rin tries to fight them, Archer suddenly defends them from her attacks. Citing Saber's change in alliegance to Caster's side, Archer pledges his allegiance to Caster, revealing that she is the ancient Greek princess Medea and allowing her to stab him with Rule Breaker, which removes Rin's Command Seals. Kuzuki then tries to kill Rin, but she is saved by a recovered Shiro. When Caster counters with Golems, Archer stops her and has her release Shir and Rin as a condition for him joining forces with her. While on their way back to Shiro's home, Rin confesses that Archer joined Caster because he knew Rin's strategies were hopelessly flawed. Shiro counters by telling her that even though she failed this time, it doesn't mean she was wrong. After comforting her, Shiro returns the jewel he found at her house, telling her that he has another one at his home. When Rin asks why he rescued her, Shiro confesses that he has feelings for her, which initially embarrasses her. However, she then thanks him for saving her life.Shiro returns home and reminisces about how Kiritsugu's ideals and the Fuyuki City fire ten years ago inspired him to become a hero of justice.

When Rin asks why he rescued her, Shiro confesses that he has feelings for her, which initially embarrasses her. However, she then thanks him for saving her life.At his home, Shiro tells Rin that he plans on continuing to fight in the Holy Grail War, even without a Servant. She replies that she has no choice but to let him before reaffirming their partnership. While discussing a strategy to defeat Caster and rescue Saber, the two decide to team up with Illyasviel, since Archer had told Rin that Berserker is in fact the ancient Greek hero Heracles, which might give them an advantage against Caster. Meanwhile, Caster recounts the time when she was summoned for the Holy Grail War by another magus, only to be unsatisfied by his inefficient method of acquiring mana for her. After Caster asked that she be allowed to acquire mana herself, the magus realized he could not trust a magic user better than himself. As a result, he contacted Kirei and asked for another Servant, but Kirei told him to dispatch Caster first before making another Master-Servant pact. The magus then sent out a contract for Caster's death to Lancer's Master, a colleague. In the meantime, she destroyed the magus's workshop, and then killed him when he returned and tried to use his Command Seals to force her into committing suicide. She was then gravely injured by Lancer and barely escaped with her life, but was saved by Kuzuki, who became her new Master. In the present day, Illyasviel observes Shiro and Rin traveling to her villa and sends her out maids to receive them. However, the villa is breached by Shinji and his new Servant, who reveals that the Holy Grail's vessel is being held inside Illyasviel. When the maids try to protect Illyasviel, the Servant kills them with a Noble Phantasm that summons numerous swords. He is then confronted by Illyasviel, who orders Berserker to attack him.Ten years ago, in the aftermath of the Fourth Holy Grail War, Illyasviel had a vision of her mother Irisviel, who claimed her husband and Illyasviel's father, a participant in the war, betrayed them by refusing to accept the Holy Grail when it presented itself to him. At first, she refused to believe it, but realized the truth when her father did not return home. As time passed, she stumbled upon a room in her home, containing numerous homunculi that were created to serve Illyasviel's purpose, only to fail in their missions. Realizing she too is a homunculus from their dying messages, Illyasviel became disillusioned with her life. Later on, she met her current maids, who assisted her in summoning Berserker. However, she initially did not want him, resolving to participate and win the Holy Grail War by herself. During the final test of her Master-Servant link ritual, she was separated from Berserker and lost her way in the nearby woods. A pack of wolves attacked her, but she was rescued by Berserker and she realized he protected her of his own free will afterwards. In the present day, Illyasviel and Berserker continue their battle against Shinji's Servant as Shir and Rin arrive to witness the event. As the battle reaches the main entrance, the Servant eventually restrains Berserker using chains fired from his Noble Phantasm, allowing him to impale Berserker with a large spear. Then, he blinds and then stabs Illyasviel with a sword; as she crawls to Berserker's side, it makes one last attempt to strike the Servant, only to be killed. Shir tries to intervene, but Illyasviel dies in comfort, believing Berserker is still at her side.As Shinji's Servant tears out Illyasviel's heart from her corpse, Shiro and Rin confront him and Shinji himself. When Rin threatens to kill Shinji, the two are forced to leave, but not before Shinji reveals his Servant's name to be Gilgamesh. While burying Illyasviel, Rin confronts Shiro about his ideals and tells him that he needs to prioritize himself over others, otherwise he will break. He refutes this by telling her of the time Kiritsugu rescued him, which caused him to admire him. However, Rin tells him that it is still wrong to value the lives of others over his own, citing that someone who was spared from a terrible tragedy has to live out their life to the fullest and that wishing for the happiness of others is no different from a machine. Despite her argument, Shir remains committed to his ideals. Later on, as they evaluate Gilgamesh's power and conclude that Caster is still their priority, the two are approached by Lancer, who offers his assistance, which they accept. Meanwhile, Archer learns that Kuzuki is helping Caster return to her original era using the Holy Grail. Archer later confronts Shir, Rin, and Lancer as they arrive at the church. Lancer engages Archer to give Shiro and Rin time to breach the church. As they do so, Rin informs Shiro that only one jewel (the same one he previously returned to her) exists in the world, and that Archer had already returned such a jewel to her.Shiro and Rin confront Caster and Kuzuki, who engage them in battle. Meanwhile, Lancer overwhelms Archer with his attacks, after which Archer mocks his sense of loyalty and honor, thus infuriating him. As a result, Lancer tries to use his powerful Noble Phantasm to strike him down, but Archer is able to barely counter it with a magical barrier, which expends most of his strength in the process and destroys the church. After praising Lancer's power, Archer reveals he staged his betrayal of Rin so he could take advantage of Caster when she had her guard down, prompting Lancer to leave. Back at the church, Shiro and Rin are both overwhelmed by their opponents, but Archer suddenly appears and ambushes Kuzuki, firing several swords at him. Caster shields Kuzuki from the swords and is impaled herself. As she dies, she confesses to Kuzuki that her wish has already been granted. Kuzuki then tries to fight Archer, explaining that since he had participated in disrupting the usual proceedings of the Holy Grail War, he had to finish what he had started. He is then stabbed by Archer and crushed by a collapsing pillar. As Shiro attends to the captive Saber, Archer suddenly traps Rin inside a cage of swords and declares his intention, as a \"Guardian\", to killSaber risks disappearing, since she is without a Master to anchor her to the world, but defends Shir from Archer, stating that she swore an oath to protect him and that it remains unchanged. However, she is overwhelmed by Archer, forcing Shiro to intervene and take over in the fight. Rin takes advantage of Archer's distraction to form a Master-Servant pact with Saber, which she accepts, therefore making her Rin's new Servant. Fully restored, she subdues Archer, who mocks her for her wish of rectifying her legacy. He then casts Reality Marble, a spell that creates an alternate reality. Shiro, Rin, and Saber are subsequently transported to Unlimited Blade Works, Archer's Noble Phantasm, which is an alternate reality consisting of a barren wasteland filled with swords and floating gears. Archer creates several swords and fires them at her, but Shir summons a sword of his own and destroys them, dissipating Unlimited Blade Works as a result. A weakened Archer grabs Rin, intending to use her as an insurance policy against Shir and Saber while he recuperates. Before he flees, Shiro tells him to meet with him at Illysaviel's villa. Later on, a restrained Rin wakes up in the villa's basement after having another dream about Archer, and confronts him about his past as a Guardian. Then, Shinji and Gilgamesh arrive, and Archer agrees to give Rin to them for their own needs after he has finished killing Shir. Back at his house, Shiro tells Saber to let him battle Archer while she saves Rin, also implying that he knows Archer's true identity. As they make their way to Illysaviel's villa, they are joined by Lancer, who is also determined to rescue Rin.Shiro, Saber, and Lancer arrive at Illysaviel's villa, where they are met by Archer, who explains the true nature of his summoning: Rin had not in fact summoned him by chance, and the catalyst for his summoning was actually the pendent he carries, identical to the one Rin used to save Shiro. While Lancer runs off to retrieve Rin, Saber demands to know why Archer is so intent on killing Shiro. Archer responds that, like Shiro, he aspired to become a hero of justice and actually fulfilled that ideal, but became disillusioned by it and became a Servant so he could rectify it. He then forces Saber to reveal her back-story to Shiro: her true identity is King Arthur, who hoped to use the Holy Grail to undo her decision to become the king of Britain, as she believes it was her rule that eventually resulted in the country's destruction. When she then remarks that she and Archer are different in terms of how much they were able to live up to their ideals, Archer elaborates that when he became a Guardian in order to become a true hero of justice, he became disillusioned after he was forced to take lives in order to save many more. He eventually concluded that his ideals were shallow and that it was impossible to save everyone as he envisioned. Archer then reveals his true identity: Shiro's future self, the Counter Guardian Heroic Spirit Shiro Emiya. Meanwhile, Shinji tries to rape Rin, only for Lancer to arrive and incapacitate him. Then, Kirei suddenly appears and reveals himself to be Lancer's Master. He further reveals that it was he who killed Rin's father in the previous Holy Grail War. He then orders Lancer to kill Rin, intending to use her body as a vessel for the Holy Grail. When Lancer refuses, Kirei uses one of his many Command Seals and orders him to commit suicide, which he does. Back at the main entrance, Emiya tosses Shir one of his swords and orders him to kill himself with it. However, Shiro refuses, proclaiming that since he learned Emiya's story, he will do all he can to avoid becoming him. As a result, he and Emiya prepare to engage each other in battle.Shiro and Heroic Spirit Shiro Emiya begin their battle, with Shiro finding that while he is only barely able to hold off Emiya's attacks, he is slowly becoming stronger the longer he clashes with Emiya. Meanwhile, Kirei prepares to take Rin's heart against Shinji's protests. However, Lancer, mortally wounded but still alive, fatally stabs Kirei. Shinji, on the verge of insanity, takes this opportunity to try to rape Rin again, only to be chased off by Lancer, who lightly wounds him. After freeing Rin, he collapses to the ground and laments how he would have liked for Rin to be his Master. Both Rin and Lancer bid farewell to each other, and as Rin leaves, Lancer sets a fire to destroy both himself and Kirei's corpse. Back at the main entrance, Shiro and Emiya continue to battle, with Emiya activating Unlimited Blade Works and slowly gaining the upper hand. As their swords clash, Shiro begins to see Emiya's memories and becomes aware of what his future holds in store for him. With his belief shaken, Shiro is quickly defeated by Emiya and left on the verge of death. As he lies on the ground, Shiro begins to reflect on the memories he gained from Emiya, as well as the memories of Kiritsugu saving him ten years ago. From this, Shiro concludes his ideals are not wrong, and he decides to continue to fight. At that moment, Saber's scabbard Avalon, which Kiritsugu had placed inside Shiro to heal the injuries he sustained from the fire, activates and heals Shiro's wounds. With his confidence in his ideals restored, Shiro prepares to battle Emiya again, with the declaration that he will defeat him.Shiro and Emiya continue their battle, with Emiya chastising Shir for continuing to pursue his ideal and declaring that he will remove every trace of him in existence. However, as the battle continues, Emiya begins to realize that Shiro, being himself, will never give up and that it is pointless to defeat him now. Finally, as he explains the beauty he saw in his ideal, Shiro's spirit begins to overwhelm Unlimited Blade Works, and he rushes Emiya. Emiya tries to react, but he becomes distracted by a flashback of Kiritsugu's last moments and is wounded by Shiro, just as Rin arrives. With this, Emiya admits defeat and allows Shiro, Rin, and Saber to escape, before being impaled by three swords fired from Gilgamesh's Noble Phantasm. Declaring his hatred for fakes, Gilgamesh fires more swords at Shiro and Emiya, but Emiya pushes Shiro out of the way and dies after taking the full blow of the attack. Saber, expressing a familiarity with Gilgamesh, demands to know why he is here, and he explains that after the end of the Fourth Holy Grail War, in which he was an Archer-class Servant, he bathed in the Holy Grail during its destruction at the hands of Saber, also a Servant in that war, and took physical form. He then explains the Holy Grail's true function as a container for thousands of curses, before announcing his intention to take it for himself and use it as a weapon to eradicate the human race, being disgusted by the lifestyle of modern humans and hoping to rule over any potential survivors. He then leaves the villa and later finds Shinji in the forest, learning from him about Kirei's death and the reason behind Rin's escape. When Shinji asks about finding a vessel for the Holy Grail, Gilgamesh implants Illyasviel's heart into him, deeming him a worthy vessel, and leaves him as he begins to mutate into a massive, shapeless form of flesh.Returning to Shiro's home, he, Rin, and Saber all decide to avenge Emiya and stop Gilgamesh by destroying the Holy Grail once and for all. Through the use of familiar spirits, Rin deduces that the Holy Grail is being summoned at Ryuudou Temple. She then explains that Shinji, the only other magus participating in the Holy Grail War, would be the only viable candidate as a substitute vessel, as it was apparent Illysaviel was supposed to turn into the Lesser Grail at the end of the war. While devising a strategy to defeat Gilgamesh, Rin realizes Emiya was the only one able to perfectly counter him, since he had the ability to summon a duplicate of any kind of weapon. She then concludes that Shiro needs to master Unlimited Blade Works so he too can match up against Gilgamesh. Since he doesn't have the sufficient mana to do so, Rin improvises, performing a ritual that implants her Magic Crest into Shiro, thus allowing them to share their mana storage. During the ritual, Shiro inadvertently taps into Rin's memories, something that embarrasses Rin when she finds out. Afterwards, Shiro finds Saber exploring his house, and she thanks him for showing her the way to her dream. Then, she has him promise that he and Rin will survive the Holy Grail War. Meanwhile, Gilgamesh has finished transporting Shinji to Ryuudou Temple, which summons the Holy Grail.Shiro and Rin plan to breach Ryuudou Temple and rescue Shinji while Saber fights Gilgamesh and destroys the Holy Grail. Saber reveals she can only use her Noble Phantasm, Excalibur, once before fading, since Rin cannot supply her with enough mana due to her sharing it with Shiro. At Ryuudou Temple, Shiro and Rin observe Shinji's mutated form and a torrent of black ooze pouring out from the Holy Grail, pooling around Shinji and forming a lake. They are then confronted by Gilgamesh, who elaborates on his intentions and explains that there are too many people in the modern era without significance or purpose. At the main gate, Saber instead comes across Assassin, who is still guarding the temple despite Caster's death, as it is his anchor to the world. He reveals that he is not actually the fictitious Sasaki Kojiro, but a nameless swordsman similar to him, then expresses a desire to finish his duel with Saber before he fades. As Shiro duels Gilgamesh, the Holy Grail is bombarded by what Gilgamesh claims to be mankind's malevolent wishes. Rin approaches the mass of flesh and manages to remove Shinji from it, causing it to try and use Gilgamesh as a replacement vessel. However, he defends himself with his most powerful Noble Phantasm, a sword called Ea. Meanwhile, Assassin reveals to Saber he is already starting to fade and uses his Noble Phantasm, but Saber reveals Excalibur's blade, dodges his strike, and fatally wounds him.With Shiro largely incapacitated by Ea's effects, Gilgamesh mocks his ideals. Shiro admits the flaws in his idealism, but reaffirms his dream nonetheless. As Gilgamesh attempts to finish him off, Saber arrives and blocks his attack, but is ordered by Shiro to save Rin. Having an epiphany about the true nature of his powers, Shiro activates Unlimited Blade Works and uses its infinite number of replica swords to counter Gilgamesh's Noble Phantasm. Meanwhile, Saber approaches the Holy Grail and recognizes it as a corrupted, improperly-summoned Servant called Angra Mainyu. She locates Rin, who uses two Command Seals and orders her to destroy the Grail with Excalibur as she is being consumed by Angra Mainyu. When Rin loses hope of surviving, Archer's voice reprimands her for giving up, and a barrage of swords strikes Angra Mainyu, freeing her. With Rin free and using her final Command Seal to augment her attack, Saber unleashes Excalibur and destroys Angra Mainyu's manifestation and the Holy Grail. As she fades, Saber admits that she would have liked to stay with Rin and Shiro, but accepts that her role is over. Inside Unlimited Blade Works, Shiro begins to overwhelm Gilgamesh, who furiously draws Ea, but Shir severs his arm and slashes his chest before running out of mana. Gilgamesh, grievously injured but alive, prepares to finish him off, but a portal to the Holy Grail opens and engulfs him. He ensnares Shiro with a chain in order to pull himself out, but Archer, having survived Gilgamesh's attack, intervenes by shooting a dagger into Gilgamesh's head, fatally wounding him. As he speaks his last words, Gilgamesh is consumed by Angra Mainyu before the portal closes. Rin and Archer say goodbye as he fades away, with Archer asking her to look after his past self. Shiro reunites with Rin, and they walk off together.Two years after the events of the Fifth Holy Grail War, Shiro and Rin are living together in an apartment in London while they both study under the Mages Association at the Clock Tower, with Shiro being Rin's apprentice as protection for her. However, he is still struggling with following his ideals without following the same path as Archer. One day, Rin has a duel with fellow classmate and neighbor, Luviagelita Edelfelt, who repeatedly flirts with Shiro, and loses, much to her chagrin. Afterwards, she and Shiro talk about his invitation to officially join the Mages Association, which conflicts with his ideals. One morning, Rin decides to take Shir to Glastonbury, the final resting place of King Arthur, so he could say goodbye to Saber. During the trip back home, Shiro reminisces about his graduation from his second year of high school. The next day, Shir encounters Waver Velvet, a survivor of the Fourth Holy Grail War, who questions him about his reasons for coming to the Clock Tower and studying magic after surviving the Holy Grail War. Shiro says he knows it to be stupid, but he wants to dedicate his life to fulfilling his ideal. Waver responds that while his desire is indeed idiotic, it is not something to be laughed at. Later, Shir returns to the apartment and informs Rin he has turned down the invitation, saying that he cannot change who he is, even if he is destined to meet the same fate as Archer. Rin responds that the difference between him and Archer will be how far he goes in following his ideals. She then assures him that she will always be by his side.\nIn the epilogue, Archer is shown sitting in Unlimited Blade Works, reconsidering his life and purpose. While he admits his regrets and curses the path he took, he asserts in the end that he was not wrong in his ideals."
