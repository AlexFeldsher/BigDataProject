        "plot outline": "Hiram Na Alaala narrates how one soldier's trauma became instrumental in cataclysmically sustaining and bringing back great love between man and woman. In the series, Ivan (Dennis) and Joseph (Rocco) instantly became friends when they were deployed to war. They overcome the ravages of armed conflict with Joseph's tales of great love for Andrea (Kris), while highlighting shared memories of their years together as lovers, and this is much to Ivan's amusement. However, in an encounter with rebels, both men were captured, imprisoned and tortured. Fate separates them. Joseph is left in captivity while Ivan is rescued by the military. The suffering Ivan experienced triggered him to assume the identity of Joseph, while losing memories, perception, and awareness of his own life and past. With this regained freedom and assumed identity, Ivan finds great love in the arms of Andrea as Joseph. Meanwhile, Andrea was devastated when she found out that Joseph was missing. But she will be surprised when Ivan claims that he is Joseph. Andrea eventually falls for Ivan because through him, she feels Joseph is still around. She sustains her great love for Joseph by reliving her shared memories with her missing lover. On the other hand, when Joseph was eventually saved, he later finds out that Ivan and Andrea are already in love with each other. He thinks that he was betrayed by his best friend and girlfriend and is now left with the daunting challenge of bringing back Andrea's great love for him. The same goes with Bethany (Lauren), Ivan's girlfriend. When Ivan returns after being rescued from rebels, Bethany is surprised to find out that her boyfriend is claiming that he is Joseph. What makes things worse is the fact that Ivan doesn't remember her and he thinks he is in love with someone else. Bethany will do everything to get Ivan back.",
