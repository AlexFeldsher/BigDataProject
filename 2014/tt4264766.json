In each episode, comedian Mo Mandel travels to a different city and settles once and for all, which bar owner has the best recipe for success.

It's an enjoyable rollercoaster ride of comical conflicts and one-upmanship, as the bosses compete to see who can win over new staff and customers with their charm and skill.",
