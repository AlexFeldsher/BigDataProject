            "Johnny Turturro gets his own case. He has to infiltrate and bust a cabal of cellphone conterfeiters that happens to be run by a ruthless Malaysian-American crime figure (fictional of course). In each episode, he enlists the help of a different Graceland roommate to get the job done. This series is a great way to learn more about and get more personally connected to Johnny as a continuing character on the show (played with charming brilliance by the very talented Manny Montana). The final ep. has a really fun \"home-made movie\" that is definitely not the usual thing you'd see in the series, but fits the playful side of the characters' personalities. Each of the original 3-4 minute mini-episodes were produced in May of 2014 and rolled out on USANetwork.com one at a time after each new Graceland Season Two episode appeared live on TV. They are sponsored by Toyota."
