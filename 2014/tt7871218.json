            "Ethan and Grayson Dolan, collectively known as the _Dolan Twins_ (qv), are social media influencers and comedians, posting entertaining videos every Tuesday for their almost 9 million subscribers. Ethan was born 20 minutes before Grayson on December 16th, 1999, in New Jersey. They also have an older sister, Cameron Dolan. The two first gained fame on the video app, Vine, but eventually steered towards the YouTube route, and everything blew up from there. The twins have gone on tour, created their own exclusive channel for VIP members, and won many awards. Ethan and Grayson Dolan stand out from other You-tubers because they stay away from advertisements, sponsorships, and \"You-tuber\" tendencies. They are down-to-earth, honest, kind, and genuinely care about their fans. Ethan and Grayson are also a part of the \"Sister Squad\" a 4 person YouTube group named by James Charles, a beauty guru. Along with the twins and James, there is yet another YouTube sensation, comedian and occasional vlogger, Emma Chamberlain. \"Sister Squad\" videos not only boost their view and subscriber count, but the 4 are all actually best friends behind the camera, too. The _Dolan Twins_ (qv) are known for making people smile through their love of making videos and entertaining their audience.::Amelia Fuentes",
            "The _Dolan Twins_ (qv) directed their first music video, \"Hawaiian Party\" by Cubsport, with Ethan Dolan on-screen and Grayson Dolan behind-the-scenes. The music video depicts three different relationships, one with a boy and girl, another with two girls, and finally, two boys. Throughout the video, each teen expresses their love for their significant other, even if it means overcoming the internal obstacles of being vulnerable.::Amelia Fuentes"
