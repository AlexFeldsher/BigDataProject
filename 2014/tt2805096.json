            "At the center of \"_Chicago P.D._ (qv)\" is Det. Sgt. Hank Voight (Jason Beghe), who is at ground zero against the war on crime in Chicago. He will do anything to bring criminals to justice. From multiple Emmy Award-winning executive producer Dick Wolf and the team behind the hit series \"Chicago Fire,\" \"_Chicago P.D._ (qv)\" is a riveting police drama about the men and women of the Chicago Police Department's elite Intelligence Unit, combating the city's most heinous offenses - organized crime, drug trafficking, high-profile murders and beyond. Hand-picked as the head of the unit is Voight, who has assembled a team of diverse detectives who share his passion, and commitment to keep the city safe. They include Det. Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda), who is more level-headed and \"by the book\" than his counterpart; Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer), a brash young detective who previously saw active military duty in the Middle East; Halstead's partner Erin Lindsay (Sophia Bush), a former \"bad girl\" who turned her life around with Voight's help; Alvin Olinsky (Elias Koteas), an experienced undercover detective and confidante for Voight; and Adam Ruzek (Patrick John Flueger), a quick-witted cadet plucked from the police academy as Olinsky's partner. The unit also includes two rising young uniform cops - Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins), a charismatic patrolman who has an active social life, and Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati), a patrol officer who strives to one day become a part of the elite Intelligence Unit. Sheldon Jin (Archie Kao) is the tech geek in charge of surveillance and tech ops.::NBC Television"
