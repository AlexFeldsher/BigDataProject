        "plot outline": "Is there anyone out there who hasn't heard of Candide? Yet, who made an effort at school to really understand it? We tried to rethink the book, and let the eternal questions disturb the silence of our sofas. Devastating love, 2D blood, leper and hunt: Candide forever. The TV series contains 13 episodes, each one running seven minutes. The pilot, having received a grant from the Hungarian Media Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA) was finished in March 2014. It is made with 2D digital animation. Our goal is to include contemporary references in the narrative where appropriate. Our series' main target audience is the age group from 14-18, as it is a required reading material for them at school. The adaptation would recognizably follow the plot of the original work, thus corresponding to the requirements of the educational prep materials. In the body of the story, we aim to apply the contemporary modular narrative tools. By disengaging the present-day timeline of the episodic plot, we can cross over from events the past to the possible future of upcoming episodes, with the help of reminiscence (flashback) and predictions (flash forward). With each episode and through various locations, we follow our naïve and hopelessly optimist hero, Candide, on his journey. Throughout the story, the main heroes change and evolve while learning the workings of the world surrounding them. In each episode, the three main characters meet under different circumstances; as if those were previous lives, they don't remember their roles played in previous episodes. The series' finale reserves several conclusions, similar to the original work. The most important conclusion is the wisdom of \"Let us cultivate our garden\".",
