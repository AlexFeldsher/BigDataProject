Ben (goofy but charming) is excited for this summer and his first crack at being head boys counselor, however instead of playing tug of war or dodge ball with campers he ends up spending much more time trying to help his favorite camper (Corey, an endearing outcast) win over Haley and trying to keep Pedro from stealing away his job as well as something (or someone) he didn't realize he cared about so much. Much like it's Shakespearean inspiration, thanks to a little scheming by a rogue camper this series dissolves into a boys against girls \"Merry War of the Sexes\" where the characters are forced to overcome jealousy, deceit, awkwardness, selfishness, and their past in an effort to find the perfect person to give a more-than-just-friends-ship bracelet to.",
