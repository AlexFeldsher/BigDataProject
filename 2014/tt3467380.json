He will continue to stand next to Seyit as his best friend while putting obstacles in his way and trying to destroy their relationship with Shura. Her love to Seyit matures Shura - In time she turns from a young girl to a passionate and self-confident woman who can struggle against difficulties - Seyit's father Mirza Mehmet Eminof doesn't accept Shura as a bride despite her beauty and nobleness - His condition is that Seyit has to marry a Turkish girl - Seyit wasn't defeated at war but he got defeated against his family. But Seyit doesn't let go of Shura's hand despite the deep respect he feels for his father. Seyit's existence in Crimea is leaving his family in a difficult situation because of the new conditions in the country - Seyit takes a risk and makes a difficult journey towards Istanbul taking his pricks of conscience with him - A different struggle awaits him in Istanbul which is occupied - While starting a new life, the things they have left behind will be the obstacles on their paths.::ahmetkozan"
