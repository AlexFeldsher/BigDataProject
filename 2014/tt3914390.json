However, when a strange phenomenon occurs, she immediately finds herself thrown into the middle of a secret war between worlds.

Dive into a world where the impossible becomes your greatest weapon and your worst threat; a world filled with fierce warriors, monsters, and giant pink bunnies. What destiny awaits a girl living in a world of shadows? When a lie is the social order, will she betray her heart, her allies, and her friends for survival? What she finds on her journey and the resulting \"truths\" she finally justifies as reality ... may ultimately lead to the end of all existence.",
