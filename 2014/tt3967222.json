To add a cherry on top, there is a slight ode to Robert Altman, as our characters will come in and out of each others lives in unforeseen ways and makes us realize what a patchwork of a community that we have here in this vast and beautiful state.",

            "_Bless Yer Heart_ (qv) is a universe all of itself. The perception of reality is a bit skewed but charmingly so, like that of \"Portlandia.\" We want to touch on the diversity that we have in Georgia, and depict life in a heightened reality in which no one is safe. We are equal opportunity offenders in that way. But the performances are grounded like that of \"Arrested Development\". To add a cherry on top, there is a slight ode to Robert Altman, as our characters will come in and out of each others lives in unforeseen ways and makes us realize what a patchwork of a community that we have here in this vast and beautiful state.::mr"
