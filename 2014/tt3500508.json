            "When a sea captain loses all his cargo in a shipwreck, he faces an unimaginable choice: to give his ship to the heartless prince to whom he is indebted, or to send one of his daughters to work for him. His younger daughter Bella slips away and presents herself in the prince's castle. Prince Leon is known for his cruelty and capricious behavior, and wears a mask to hide an ugly scar. But he is also tormented by a secret from his past. Initially charmed by Bella's beauty and unflinching courage, he seeks to make her another of his conquests, even making a bet with his cousin he can seduce her within weeks. But Bella is not so easily swayed. Beautifully filmed in northern Italy, this lush and passionate take on a classic tale relies not on magic, but something more powerful. Can the ocean be tamed? Can a beast be worthy of love?::Renee"
