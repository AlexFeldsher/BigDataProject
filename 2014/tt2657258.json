            "Of all the notorious lawmen who ever patrolled the violent Texas frontier, none are more storied than the Texas Rangers. And none could be more macho. While the once all-male bastion now allows \"lady rangers\", no one can say they are welcomed. Being the only female ranger in this elite squad isn't going to stop Molly Parker (Tricia Helfer BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA), she's ballsy and badass enough to get the job done despite a good-ole network filled with harassment and discrimination. In another profession, being a stunning former beauty queen might open doors but for Molly... that distinction only makes it harder. Molly is committed to finding the truth and seeing justice served; a trait no doubt inherited from her father, a former Texas sheriff. She's even willing to break some rules to get it done. While she's surrounded by law enforcement colleagues who want to see her fail, including Police Lieutenant Guillermo Salazar, there are those within the Rangers who have her back like her boss, Company Commander Leroy Barrow. Molly also has the support of her loving family including her brother Billy, his wife Nessa and their two precocious daughters, Ada and Hailee, who revere their role-model aunt. On the verge of getting divorced from her smarmy husband Jake, Molly relishes her new found freedom even as she begins an affair with a sexy, dangerously handsome DEA agent, Dan Winston (Marc Blucas, KNIGHT AND DAY, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS). She could be the one woman that captures this bad boy's heart but neither is ready to pull the trigger...yet. From executive producer Sofia Vergara (MODERN FAMILY) and written by Hannah Shakespeare, step inside the dangerous world of the Texas Rangers from the female perspective and experience the arresting KILLER WOMEN."
