In this game, couples who are confident in themselves and believe in their relationship can turn that into a lot of money. In this game, the winning couple's relationship determines the size of the prize. 8 couples - one villa - 6 weeks - 12 programs 3 assignments in each cycle - Men's Assignment / Women's Assignment / Couples' Assignment In the Men's Assignment each of the women bets on the success of her partner in the assignment. The men do not know the sum of the bet. The men carry out the assignment. Success in the assignment doubles the betting sum. Failure in the assignment deducts the betting sum. The same then takes place with the women. At the end of the two assignments (men and women), the couple who has accumulated the lowest sum of money is up for elimination from the villa. The third assignment is the Couples' Assignment which empowers the relationship and tests the cooperation between the partners. At the end of the Couples' Assignment, two couples are up for elimination - the couple who came in last in the assignment and the couple that accumulated the lowest sum of money. The other couples vote and decide which of the two couples will remain in the villa and in the game. The eliminated couples leave the villa with nothing... The winning couple takes all the money they have accumulated! Love and partnership wins! Power Couple is a new and different experience in the reality show genre bringing a lot of humor, emotions and love to the screen and not only intrigues and conspiracies!",

In this game, couples who are confident in themselves and believe in their relationship can turn that into a lot of money. In this game, the winning couple's relationship determines the size of the prize. 8 couples - one villa - 6 weeks - 12 programs 3 assignments in each cycle - Men's Assignment / Women's Assignment / Couples' Assignment In the Men's Assignment each of the women bets on the success of her partner in the assignment. The men do not know the sum of the bet. The men carry out the assignment. Success in the assignment doubles the betting sum. Failure in the assignment deducts the betting sum. The same then takes place with the women. At the end of the two assignments (men and women), the couple who has accumulated the lowest sum of money is up for elimination from the villa. The third assignment is the Couples' Assignment which empowers the relationship and tests the cooperation between the partners. At the end of the Couples' Assignment, two couples are up for elimination - the couple who came in last in the assignment and the couple that accumulated the lowest sum of money. The other couples vote and decide which of the two couples will remain in the villa and in the game. The eliminated couples leave the villa with nothing... The winning couple takes all the money they have accumulated! Love and partnership wins! Power Couple is a new and different experience in the reality show genre bringing a lot of humor, emotions and love to the screen and not only intrigues and conspiracies!"
