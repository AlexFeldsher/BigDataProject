            "Online dating is a multi-billion dollar industry that capitalizes on people who are all looking for the same thing: love. Now, each persons definition of love or the type of love they are seeking may vary but all in all, love is what people are searching for when doing online dating. With this series, we are bringing to the forefront the different types of people, situations, humor and cynicism that encompasses how many people feel about online dating both those who participate in online dating and those who have tried and it never worked out. This series revolves around the lives of three roommates, Ava, Bree and Cara (ABC) as they navigate the treacherous and unforgiving online dating world. The series opens with one of the roommates, Cara, being broken up with unexpectedly. As she is scrolling through the pictures of the two of them, she comes across an ad for an online dating website: meet Mr. and Mrs. Right. Cara decides to join, but doesn't want to do it alone. Cara candidly talks her two roommates, Ava and Bree, into joining the site as well. The series will follow the ladies as they go on a series of awful (and sadly non-fiction) bad online dates."
