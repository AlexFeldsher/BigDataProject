After landing a contracted long-term commercial role as the face of Stay Strong Condoms, he bought a house in an L.A. suburb and opened his doors to starving artists trying to make it in Hollywood. Now breaking into a new career path, Dave started a management company, WINNERS TALENT, and represents each of his tenants as their manager and life coach. These tenants, whom Dave calls his \"_Winners_ (qv)\", include an array colorful characters: a lazy actor (Ty), a talentless pageant queen (Sophia), an awkward comedienne (Liz), an aspiring Sci Fi writer/blogger (Nathan), and a \"slash\" (Porter). The series follows these characters as they try to make it in Los Angeles, and how they interact as room-mates.::Paul Carganilla"
