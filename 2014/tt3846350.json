Whether it is with reproductive intentions, as a business or even as a spiritual therapy, there are so many ways to practice it as ways to see life. This is the case of the thirteen characters on the exciting documentary series \"There is a first time for everything\", who show us a different approach on sex in each episode, where pleasure and eroticism lead them to self-discovery, but also to comprehend the other side, where stigmas fall when discovering their rituals and motivations, and where maybe, you will enjoy something that you had not in a long time: a first time.::Btf"
