From now until the end of 2014, we'll be talking with our guests about the different aspects of movement and how movement (in all its forms) impacts your business. We'll inspire and motivate you at the beginning of the show, so that your energy is up and your stress is down. Then, it's time to get educated - by our guest and by YOU, our #SuperTroopers . We believe that sharing experiences is one of the most powerful ways to learn, so we want to hear from you about your experience with this week's subject: *HUMILITY* Do you need to learn to be successful in business? Are there things you don't need to learn, or is there such a thing as too much learning? Get the conversation started on the event page, and of course, post any questions you'd like to have answered during the show! And don't forget the Lightning Round! It's up to YOU to tell us how this week's show moved you. Did you have an \"aha\" moment, were you able to identify with something that was said? We want to hear all about it with the hashtag #LightningRound after the show. We're thrilled to have David Amerland #MRSemanticSearch as this week's #plusonesuperhero!",
