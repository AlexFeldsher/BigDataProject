            "An L.A. family with serious boundary issues have their past and future unravel when a dramatic admission causes everyone's secrets to spill out.",
            "Mort has a secret that he really wants to tell his three adult children, who are so self-absorbed they don't see that something has changed for divorced, girlfriendless dad. Even when he invites them to dinner en masse to share his news, somehow, the conversation becomes about them. The secret unfolds, though, when he comes home and sees his married daughter getting intimate with her ex. Now, he knows her secret; she learns his; and the dysfunctional family finds one secret after another being exposed.::Jwelch5742",
            "Past middle age, Los Angeles area college professor Mort Pfefferman decides to act upon something he has felt all his life: to transition from being a male to a female. That transition includes becoming \"Maura\" instead of Mort. Maura looks for support from a new set of friends who have gone through the process before. A factor into Maura's process is her self-absorbed adult children: housewife and mother Sarah who seeks something else outside of that traditional family life; music executive Josh, whose own sexual history stems back to a long term relationship with someone known to the family; and chronically unemployed Ali, who is not averse to asking for money to more than live comfortably. Thrown into the mix is the children's mother, Mort's ex-wife Shelly who feels she has not had an identity of her own most of her life with Mort and the kids. As Maura goes through this process, she may discover there is precedent within her family, which may funnel down to the next generation as well.::Huggo"
