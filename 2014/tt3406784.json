Throughout the competition, team members' classmates will be on the sidelines screaming for their favorite students as they pump up intensity levels to extreme proportions. Long-held rivalries will reignite and school spirit will be abundant...getting each student's competitive juices flowing to the max during all of the explosive action! This one-of-a-kind, hard-hitting College Arm Wrestling show will feature four teams with four members on each team (2 males and 2 females) as they go head-to-head (and arm-to-arm) with team members from rival schools. Each of the teams will be a part of the new College Arm Wrestling League (also known as the new CAWL). The CAWL will crown a new winning team on an annual basis. The inaugural season will consist of 3 episodes...the first two episodes will be the preliminary rounds and Episode 3 will be the FINALS!",
