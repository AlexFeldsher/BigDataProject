Twenty-five years later, mankind survives in a few fortified cities. The Archangel Michael has chosen to side with humanity against Gabriel, living among humans in the fortified city of Vega (once Las Vegas).As Michael struggles to fight against his brother (Gabriel), in favor of humanity, the politics of Vega struggle to keep peace in an ongoing war.\nAlex, a young soldier in the V system of Vega (giving each citizen a job and a social class), is the chosen one. He is the one bearing the markings, the last message from God. Saved by Michael as a baby and abandoned by his father, he had to struggle to survive amongst the lower class, only to end up in the military where he succeeds. The chosen one has only two options, save the human race as well as the angels or destroy them all."
