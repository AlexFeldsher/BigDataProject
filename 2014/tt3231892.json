The Apocalypse - many apocalypses, actually - is finally upon us. While most of the country is wiped out, a few strong, resilient individuals survive. These people, though they seem unlikely heroes, must find their ways to each other through unimaginable perils, and must band together if they hope to survive. Ranging from a 12-year-old social media starlet to a 56-year old CEO, this ragtag group must not only learn how to survive in this dangerous, confusing, post-apocalyptic world, but must learn how to trust each other and work together. But in the face of such tragedy and loss, will they be able to survive? Or will they simply become victims of the Apocalypse?",
