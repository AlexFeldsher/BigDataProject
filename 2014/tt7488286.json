        "plot outline": "Through its more than sixty books, Octavio Paz displayed a fascinating array of works through his eighty-four years of life. Since his high school years he was noted for his passionate poetic voice, which eventually matured and expanded to the field of essay and journalism, where he became one of its most brilliant exponents. Love, eroticism, politics, art, history and literature, among many other topics were explored by the pen of Octavio Paz. With works that go from \"The Labyrinth of Solitude\" to \"In Light of India\" Paz's work has been translated into dozens of languages, has been recognized worldwide and is now a essential reference for understanding the modern day Mexico. On the centenary of his birth, the work of Paz remains as current as in its years of publication and is subject to analysis, discussion and reflection, and deserves to be read by new generations. Octavio Paz's legacy lives in his words and the light of his thought shines intensely in the 21st century.",
