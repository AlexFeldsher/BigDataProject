At stake was the historical reliability and literal truth of the Bible which was under attack by sceptical scholars.The discoveries of the Bible Hunters would shed controversial new light on the Christian origins as well as uncovering strange zodiacs, hymns to Egypts solar god, and heretical Christian texts."
