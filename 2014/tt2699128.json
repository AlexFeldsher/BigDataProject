And how the people of this fictional New York town deal with the day-to-day struggles of the disappearance of their loved ones, and of those who are gone.my personal opinion and the best part of the show is the constant thought of what will happen if one day everyone you loved was gone all it wants and the search for the answers to why. My favorite part of the show besides that it's thoughtful provoking is that each character in their own way are all connected by the same event whether they want to admit it or if they want to hide from it."
