The feelings can be so devastating and rip so deeply that one is left wondering whether the life that they knew held any significance or truth at all. One is left second guessing everything that they thought to have been true. You can be left not knowing whether you have a reason to go on in life without the love that you knew. Do you hold on to the love that you knew or do you look to find something that can fill the void that the loss had left. Only hearts dipped in time can reveal the path that is meant for a broken hearted person. This story will find you in your past at a time when you may have believed that you had found true love but were awakened by that lover's deception. This is Nykas confession of what happened to her while navigating through life, love and lies. We hope that you enjoy the many flavors of deceit.",
