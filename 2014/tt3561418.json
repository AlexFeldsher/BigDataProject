That, and the prison is filled with iron bars. Iron-y. Well, she thinks they are made of iron anyway. Probably cheaper stuff. Anyway, after six years in a single cell, Suzy has been moved into the prison with the other inmates. She quickly finds prison life to be tough and filled with thugs, crazies, and perverts. While trying to make friends and stay alive, Suzy has to also dodge the dangerous - and perhaps sexual - advances of the Prison Warden all while avoiding the shanking attention of the prison's self-proclaimed Queen Bee-tch: Carly Jackson from Perth. Will Suzy survive her sentence? Will Suzy ever return back to Aotearoa? Will she ever eat Marmite again?",
