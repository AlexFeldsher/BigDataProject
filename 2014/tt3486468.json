Suziey, the dog loving, free spirited, let's go on a hike in the desert barista, Maria the naive, high energy, way too loud, do anything for a laugh waitress, Gina the free loving hippie who can spot a sale from a mile away sound editor, and George the good looking, buff, seemingly perfect yet can't find a date photo booth operator. Despite their shortcomings, somehow they brush off every failed attempt with a smile and say maybe next time! Their blind bravery more often than not gets them tangled into many sticky situations, but the others are always there to help bail the other one out. A band of misfits, the understudy to the understudy to the understudy, the fourth string team that may never make it to the field, but no matter the obstacle, these four will always give 110%, even if they probably shouldn't.",
