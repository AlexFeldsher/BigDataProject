        "plot outline": "The Ski Channel is proud to present the life of freeskier and basejumper Mike Wilson. By the age of 13, Mike Wilson proved his athletic potential by becoming a professional skiier. His drive for more adrenaline eventually branched out to B.A.S.E jumping, pushing the limits of reality. Very precise and calculated in every flip, Wilson uses physics to an extreme level. As an innovator to skiing, Wilson was the first to land an off axis double-flipping rotation to skiing, known as the \"Wilsonflip\". Catch a glimpse of the extreme life of Mike Wilson in the 3-part series by The Ski Channel. The Ski Channel presents its original series \"Winter Sessions\" dedicated to unique athletes who go above and beyond expectations in the great outdoors. It is with great applause that we celebrate the lives of these featured individuals for their dedication to their sport and inspiring accomplishments.",
