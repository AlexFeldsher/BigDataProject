            "Life in a small town in Oregon is about to get a bit strange. Particularly for Valeri Fox (Lindy Larkspur). Working as a private investigator Valeri has known about the evils in humanity, and has spent a great deal of her young life working to locate and bring fugitives to justice assisting with many of the small towns \"Complicated Cases.\" As we all know humanity can be a very confusing and ugly thing. But evil, well as it is known to many of us, is not the evil we should be worried about..After dealing with the mysterious death of her long time mentor and adopted father Valeri is thrust into the world of \"Weird\" after meeting Damian West (Levi Castle), a member of what is known to those on this side as, \"The Agency.\" Learning more about the things unseen, the things that do go bump in the night. The things that some have been considered insane for warning us about. A real evil, one literally born out of hell. Valeri learns of her father's killer and now must navigate this newly discovered world before even wrapping her mind around it. Time for acclimation has passed..Valeri is the one that the Agency has been waiting on, the one that holds the key to winning the battle ahead, and ultimately protecting man-kind and humanity as we know it."
