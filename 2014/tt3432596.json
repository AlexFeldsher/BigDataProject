Learning to ride and tame dragons comes easy to most students at Ansarivan Dragonar Academy - except for Ash Blake, a first-year student who is known by his classmates as the \"problem child.\" Despite his unusually large star brand that marks him as a future dragon master, his dragon has never appeared. Until now, that is. One day, while challenging fellow student, princess Silvia Lautreamont, to a dragon race, Ash's dragon appears, but in a form different than any dragon ever seen before - a beautiful girl. Ash names her Eco and soon discovers that this new dragon has attitude to spare, as she promptly informs him that she is the master, and he, her servant. Ash's problems with dragon riding have only just begun.",
