            "Mei Ashley is a 22 year-old student of astrophysics in London. She was adopted as a baby from an orphanage in China by a British-American couple and she has been brought up in England. Mei is very happy. She has been - and still is - the love of her parents' life. But one day out of the blue Mei gets a message that her birth mother wants to meet her. It's a huge shock which resurfaces all her emotions and questions of being an adoptee. Terrified of telling her adoptive parents, she's relieved when they agree she should go and that she must take this journey alone. When Mei arrives in what is now a foreign land, she meets the person who contacted her, Pan Qianyi. Qianyi is a young female professional who speaks good English and wants to help Mei's mother, Ying. Mei's first meeting with Ying is not what she expected. Her mother doesn't look her in the eye. Qianyi translates that her mother needs Mei's help. Her son, Mei's younger brother, is in prison for a crime he didn't commit and facing a death sentence. They want Mei to help them expose the corruption behind his false imprisonment. Mei begins to worry she has made a mistake in coming, and when she tells her parents the truth of the situation they urge her to come home too. But when Qianyi introduces Mei to her brother, Ajun, the emotional contact between them is instantaneous and this connection makes Mei decide to stay. With Qianyi's help Mei seeks to expose the corruption behind Ajun's conviction and get him freed before it's too late. In doing so she learns about the country of her birth, its culture and institutions. Slowly she gets emotionally closer to her birth mother and her life in England becomes more distant. As her investigations spiral out of control, she realises she's willing to risk everything for the sake of her brother's freedom."
