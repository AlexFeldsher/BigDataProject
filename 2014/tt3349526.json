        "plot outline": "The life of Giovanni Versace has the flavor of a fairy tale. He was the son of a seamstress. At the end of the '60s he decided to leave Southern Italy and conquer the world, starting a revolution in the fashion scene of those days and becoming an international icon. Befriending princesses, rock stars and Hollywood idols, fashion magazines were featuring his creations on their front covers, others were portraying his glamorous lifestyle and his luxurious homes. By the end of the '70s he created the fashion house which holds his family name. This would have not been possible without the support of his family who were always by his side during these years. Versace was very close to his mother, father, brother Santo and his sister Donatella with whom he had various problematic encounters. Versace lived a very successful life, characterized by personal and professional challenges which ended in tragedy in a hot summer morning in South Beach Miami, when an insane man shot him to death at the age of 50.",
