During the trip to Kep and Kampot in the grandfather's old car and on a bamboo train, they discover from his incomplete memoirs, a secret. Grandfather Vanna left them clues to the whereabouts of some treasure hidden when he had been a part of the Pol Pot regime some forty years before. Shocked that he had been part of the Khmer Rouge, the girls are simultaneously obsessed by finding the treasure and what it might enable them to do. They all want to keep the treasure for themselves and separate, but their paths cross once more in some remote and dangerous caves. In these dark depths, their greed for the treasure unearths instead a deeper secret, of a friendship tested to the limits during this chapter of Cambodia's past. A love song composed in the caves as a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit, will be the means by which the three women put their differences behind them and transform their own conflicts into a new and beautiful harmony.",
