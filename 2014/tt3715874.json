With the suffering of the children at work and the complaints of her mother at home, Yuko can hardly get any rest and peace of mind. Sudo Shunsuke is a teaching art at a high school, but the days just flow by aimlessly for him. He dreams of creating a masterpiece and have his talent recognized by the world. His girlfriend, Kiyoka Miho, is pressuring him to get married, but Shunsuke is reluctant to do so. One day, a crime takes place in Shunsuke's neighbor's apartment. The police had deemed it a murder-suicide, based on the suicide note left behind by the son, claiming that he had killed his grandfather and parents. Detective Mamihara Koki feels there is more to it, as the brutality of the parents' murder seems uncharacteristic of the child perpetrator. He decides to pursue the case further, and soon, Shunsuke and Yuko are unwittingly pulled into the investigations.",

His girlfriend, Kiyoka Miho, is pressuring him to get married, but Shunsuke is reluctant to do so. One day, a crime takes place in Shunsuke's neighbor's apartment. The police had deemed it a murder-suicide, based on the suicide note left behind by the son, claiming that he had killed his grandfather and parents. Detective Mamihara Koki feels there is more to it, as the brutality of the parents' murder seems uncharacteristic of the child perpetrator. He decides to pursue the case further, and soon, Shunsuke and Yuko are unwittingly pulled into the investigations.::https://mydramalist.com/10444-kazokugari"
