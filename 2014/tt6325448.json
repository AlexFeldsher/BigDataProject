Spies, bandits and insurgents gather together, trying to destroy the new government by economic warfare, the act of attack and assassination. Military hero Qin Guoliang gradually realizes the importance of the economy; therefore he firmly cooperates with finance expert Luo Tianqing and combats leader Chen Zizheng, though they don't appreciate each other at the beginning. They discover enemy's schemes and protect security of state property. The soldiers who fight in the economic front bravely uncover enemies' conspiracy and stabilize the situation, which ensures the economic construction of new government and completes the mission of first issuance of RMB.",
