            "'Alan Thicke' (qv), one of Hollywood's most famous TV dads, stars in _Unusually Thicke_ (qv) (2014), an original reality sitcom. Not even seven seasons as \"Dr. Jason Seaver\" on _Growing Pains (1985)_ (qv) could prepare 'Alan Thicke' (qv) to be the patriarch of his own real-life modern family. Between his beautiful, spicy and much-younger wife 'Tanya Callau' (qv), and his dry-witted, often opinionated teen son 'Carter Thicke' (qv), Alan has his work cut out for him - in a series that follows the daily drama and humor that happens in their everyday lives."
