            "With poker, Red Bull and provocative victory cries, Petter Northug falls outside the stereotypical image we often have of a Norwegian cross-country skier.Season one was shown on TV2 January- March 2013 and achieved viewing figures up to 559,000. It was also rewarded with a \"Gullrute\" for best entertainment series the same year.There has been much circus since season one was shown on TV. In season two of Circus Northug we followed Petter through his exit with the national team and signing the Coop agreement. We also followed him through disease and when he trains up to the Olympics in Sochi.In a separate special, \"Sircus Northug: Downturn\" we get the full story behind his drunk driving, talking to Northug himself and his immediate family. We follow them all after the crisis after drink driving the fatal evening 4th May 2014."
