            "I think the uncovering aliens is a wonderful show. Despite what everyone is saying about them wanting more publicity then finding the evidence, I find this show to be very evidential and it seems that they really do devote their lives to finding out the truth for not only themselves but us. I find them very compelling and willing to do what they have to do to find out the truth.::Chelsea Bowman"
