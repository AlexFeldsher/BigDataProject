Only the Tenkai Knights - Bravenwolf, Tributon, Valorn and Lydendor - were strong enough to defeat Villius and his forces. After the warlord's defeat, neither Villius nor the Tenkai Knights were seen again.Now on planet Earth in the year 2034, Villius has returned and plots to take control of both Quarton and Earth. Four human boys - Guren, Ceylan, Toxsa, and Chooki - are chosen to be the new Tenkai Knights to defend both Earth and Quarton."
