            "Driven to Extremes is a three-part global challenge, pitting two specially-built vehicles - and more specifically the oil inside them - against three of the most difficult roads on Earth.However, inside our purpose-built Nissan Patrols will be an A-list Hollywood celebrity (Tom Hardy, Henrill Cavill and Adrien Brody) accompanied by a motorsport hero (Neil Hodgson and Mika Salo) as they take on the coldest, the hottest and the roughest roads on the planet.Watch as the stars and their driving partners tackle the chilly climes of eastern Siberia, the searing heat of the Taklamakan dessert in far western China and the uncompromising terrain of the Malaysian rainforest, with each destination providing an acid test for the vehicles, the drivers and the oil."
