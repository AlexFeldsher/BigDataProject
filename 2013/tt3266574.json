Arturo believes he is condemned and from that moment on tries to get over her, by avoiding emotional involvement with women living life like an eternal teenager. However, he is surrounded by friends who live life more attune with their age: they have partners, children and little time for parties.\nWith the help of Sofía his best friend, Arturo has achieved a relatively stable emotional state. But Irene comes back to the city and assures him she has changed, that she has matured and wants him back. Arturo swears blind that he is over the trauma of the relationship, but a mere glimpse of her makes our protagonists precarious emotional stability waver.\nArturo returns to take refuge in casual sex and alcohol. Loathing love, he will resign himself to finding a stable partner and forming a family like everyone expects. However, he will find love where he never expected it: Sofía, his intimate friend seems to be the only one capable of loving him.\n"
