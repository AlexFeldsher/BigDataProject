It harbors a rich fauna, including the red 'bobcat' lynx and a brown bear subspecies, partly being monitored as contact with humans endangered various populations, but new balances are also found, like alligator farming with dug-up eggs. A dam forced sea-river-migrating species to retreat here instead of swimming further inland, making the reserve even more vital.    "

Peet-rich waters however aren't nutritious, hence populated with specialists like flesh-eating plants.
