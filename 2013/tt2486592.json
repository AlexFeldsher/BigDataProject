            "A half-hour hidden camera prank show that takes teenagers, who think they know everything about looking after kids, and puts them to the ultimate babysitting test - one that they will never see coming. Our babysitter shows up for what they think is a routine night of babysitting but unbeknownst to them, the house is rigged with concealed cameras and everyone else involved are actors, ready to pull off the ultimate babysitting prank! Extreme Babysitting sets out to push the ridiculous meter on the usually mundane world of babysitting, without letting the babysitter know that they are actually on TV!"
