After they know which tribe the dead man is from, they go to make peace with its chief, Sheikh Lafi, who asks to marry Hasayef as a condition for peacemaking or what is called \"Ghorrat Medah\". Despite Hasayef's shock, she and the Sheikh get married and have twin boys, Iqab and Fawaz. She then asks for divorce and takes her two sons with her, who then become so famous for their courage. She hears about what Shafi is doing to the father of her sons so they come back and kick him out of the tribe. After their father's death, the two brothers fight over the leadership of the tribe. Iqab eventually gives it up to his brother Fawaz. After that, Matrouk kills Iqab and Shafi attempts to kill Fawaz, who was determined to take revenge for his uncle Sajer. Sajer protects Fawaz but he gets killed instead. Fawaz carries his body and returns with it to his grandfather's tribe, wondering how he will convince his people that he's not the killer. In the end, Hasayef meets Hashal and declines his marriage proposal after all what she's been through so they go separate ways in the midst of all sorrows.",
