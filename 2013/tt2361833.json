An out of work actor, Lorenzo Lamas, interviews for the position, telling Jimmy that he is a famous TV star. Since Jimmy is into watching movies and not much TV, he does not know who Lorenzo is. Throughout the episode, some of Jimmy's friends don't recognize Lamas either, but the Bail Bonds skips and others on the wrong side of the law do.    "
