She enjoys Godiva Chocolates and Bloody Marys and she loves to play Xbox when she's feeling feisty. While she has yet to marry or have children, she freely admits to being boy crazy and hopes to someday make-out with Robert Pattinson. Ms. Vampy is forever sexy, funny, young, and obnoxious, but her heart is as big as her mouth. If she ever bites you, it'll be with love!",
