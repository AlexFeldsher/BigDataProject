However, these businesses extend far beyond just taking bets. The crews claim to offer loans, move merchandise and solve neighborhood problems on their own terms. Southie, the largest and most powerful crew in Boston, is run by the notorious Pat Nee, famed for his battles with gangster Whitey Bulger. As the dominant crew, Southie looks to maintain their status quo, using their reputation and force to maintain order. The upstart Roslindale crew operates in a neighboring territory but is forced to pay Southie rent, a fee for operating. which has long been a source of tension. The Rozzie crew, wants to challenge Southie's power but knows there could be dire consequences. The smaller Dorchester crew finds themselves caught in the middle. They want to maintain their independent status but fear they'll be forced to pick sides if a Southie versus Rozzie battle erupts. It's a difficult position to be in, but it's the way of life on the streets.",
