This unique parcel of American real-estate, known as Tornado Alley, boasts the greatest concentration of tornadic activity, more than anywhere else in the world. This half-hour television series places the viewer right in the midst of the action with our teams of seasoned storm chasers as they endeavor to forecast and chase the most violent and dramatic thunderstorms on Earth. 1920 x 1080 high-definition cameras follow these rogue weather enthusiasts as they navigate the back roads of the plains, searching for their next encounter with Mother Nature's untamed fury. Each spring, the chasers analyze the data and carefully position themselves to catch a glimpse of the \"storm of the day\". Storm chasing is a very demanding and commonly dictates that chasers drive hundreds, even thousands of miles, crisscrossing the Great Plain states, in order to position themselves for the next storm. With chase vehicles equipped with the latest storm tracking technologies, the chasers are able to analyze up to the minute radar and satellite imagery, current observations, in addition to computer forecast models that simulate the atmosphere, depicting both current and upcoming weather patterns. These forecast models are sometimes scrutinized up to a week in advance, and update constantly as the actual day of the storm draws nearer.
