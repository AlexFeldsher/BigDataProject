These intimate portraits of artists at home and at play show a side to them rarely seen before. Largely observational documentary in style, there are also contributions from high profile curators, collectors and art commentators; from Ralf Rugoff, Director of the Hayward Gallery to Germaine Geer and, champion of public art, Mayor Michael Bloomberg.",
