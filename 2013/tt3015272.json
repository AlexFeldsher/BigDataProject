            "\"On the Reel with Tiara Williams\" features a panel of young, educated and opinionated African Americans who discuss current events; as well as the good, the bad, and the ratchet in the African American community. Our mission is to find solutions through conversation.\nTopics covered include: Why aren't some people proud of their own skin color?\nHow should the community go about co-existing with the police? What should African Americans be demanding from our reigning president, Barack Obama?\nWhy is it that our money doesn't circulate in the black community like it used to?\nDo African Americans have a certain responsibility to help the LGBT movement?"
