            "Terry and Phil pull up a chair at their local and loyal pub 'The Full English.' Its a place they call home, where they won't be judged for a dodgey hair cut, but they might get kicked out for wearing the wrong footy shirt. Every week Georgey, the lovely bar maid graces us with a couple of cold pints for our mates Terry and Phil. A good lass, she often falls for Terry's cheap chat up lines but all in all its a laugh. Phil, the quiet and simple natured soul that he is, always takes a few knocks from Terry who's hot headed imagination always gets the better of him. Terry might give it large but he means well. No matter who comes along on their pub adventures, whether it be the roaming nomad American boy, Conrad who ends up pulling pints and visiting stone hedge, or stories from their week gone by, the lads remain the best of friends. Cheers! Heres to Terry and Phil."
