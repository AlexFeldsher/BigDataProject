            "The only thing more important to Businessman and entrepreneur Rodman Schley than creating new opportunities and businesses is his family. After his wife, Gina, makes it clear it's time to simplify their fast-paced modern lifestyle and lead a greener life, Rodman is inspired to discover what he can about the movement to see what will work for him. Whether it's milking a goat in a backyard urban farm, learning how to do his part to save the bee population while working with a holistic bee keeper, or seeing how communities in Detroit are strengthening and healing themselves by tending to community gardens, Rodman is ready to look at this movement with fresh eyes.::_Urban Conversion_ (qv)"
