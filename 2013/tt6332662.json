However, till the early Republic of China, only a widow is left in the family of Jiang, sticking to traditional standards and managing Jiang's family business. As society changes, a Shanghai dancing girl comes to the Jiangs. She is pregnant and wants to marry the eldest son of the Jiangs. Moreover, the second son of the Jiangs, who is far-sighted and wise, is willing to marry a poor girl who does not want to become a member of the Jiangs. In that traditional society, the three women's conflict is inevitable. The dancing girl wants to be a member of the Jiangs, but she is disapproved by Jiangs. So she finds her ways to challenge the dignity of the Jiangs. While that poor girl, who has married herself into the family, challenges the rigid system and traditions from inside. Besides, the conservative widow tries her best to defend traditional standards in the Jiangs. Finally, Jin Feng and Zhou Qing make a great difference on the Jiangs. \"SuoMeng Lou\" opens again, which becomes a new start for the Jiangs.",
