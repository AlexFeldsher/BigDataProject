            "Ryan thought he had it all: a good job, a nice house, a sexy girlfriend. But when all of those things blow up in his face and he is forced to move in with his wacky brother Matt, Ryan learns that having it all means nothing, if it doesn't make you happy. Ryan's journey to accept this however is a long one, because as soon as Ryan arrives at his brother's apartment he realizes what a completely different life Matt is living: no job, a messy apartment with no running water, and a wacky crew of neighbors and roommates who's idea of what is an important use of time challenges everything Ryan thought about himself and the world. But maybe you can just blow off a whole day and turn everything into a game. And maybe there is love waiting for Ryan amidst the chaos. Either way, this is the story of all the upsides to your life being turned upside down.::Anonymous"
