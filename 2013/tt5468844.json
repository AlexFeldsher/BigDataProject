Over the past ten years, many hundreds of children have been deported to countries they have little or no memory of, their parents having sought political asylum in the Netherlands but ultimately been rejected, leaving them the choice of leaving voluntarily in exchange for money or being forcibly deported by the Dutch government. Politically responsible administrators guaranteed that these children would be fine in the country of their parents. But virtually nothing is known about what actually happened to them after their deportation. This series tells the story of deported children in Iraq, Afghanistan, Angola, Armenia, and Kosovo.",
