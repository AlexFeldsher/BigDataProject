With an overabundance of \"dump and stir\" shows, we hope to hit the opposite end of the market spectrum by supplying content using all-natural ingredients and recipes cooked from scratch. This show seeks to fulfill a relatable provenance to classic American cooking by tracing key ingredients through their growing, raising, fishing, hunting and following them all the way to the table. Favorite staples like grilled venison and potato salad take on whole new lives when we know both exactly where the ingredients come from and use them in modern and whimsical recipes. Ian leans on his experience in the kitchen to bring viewers entertaining and educational recipes that they will be inspired to cook for themselves and their families. After ten years of traveling the world in search of the best food, Ian realized that the way he hunts, cooks, and eats on the family farm is not only sustainable, but healthy and delicious. He will show you why eating this way is much more than just a fad - it's a sustainable, fresh and fun lifestyle. Living off the land doesn't just lead to a healthy and the environmentally friendly lifestyle, but also produces world-class food and is the picture of what American cooking can become. Viewers will feel as if they've been invited to roll up their sleeves and become part of what has become a food uprising in this country - a real-life field to table experience.",
