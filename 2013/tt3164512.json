A genius in his field, Sezaki Kota's strengths are undermined by his character flaws, namely his tendency to fall in love instantly with beautiful women. Keeping him in line is Nurse Togami Mako (Takei Emi), a former delinquent now dedicated to helping the less fortunate. Will Kota find his bride-to-be waiting on an upcoming island, or could his true love be the woman he hasn't fallen for?",
