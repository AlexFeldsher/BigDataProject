            "Philip and Elizabeth Jennings seem like your average American couple. Married for nearly 20 years they have two children, run a travel agency and live in suburbia. However, they are masking a secret double-life: they are, in fact, Russian spies, planted in the US nearly 20 years previously. It is the early-1980s and the height of the Cold War, with Philip and Elizabeth at the forefront of the USSR's attempts to gain information on US activities and weaponry. Tasked with countering espionage and tracking down Soviet spies is a special division of the FBI. Stan Beeman is one of their brightest agents. He also happens to be the Jennings's neighbour.::grantss",
            "Philip and Elizabeth Jennings are two KGB spies in an arranged marriage who are posing as Americans in suburban Washington, D.C., shortly after Ronald Reagan is elected president. The couple have two children, teenager Paige and preteen Henry, who are unaware of their parents' true identities. The complex marriage becomes more passionate and genuine each day but is continually tested as the Cold War escalates. As Philip begins to warm up to America's values and way of life, his relationship with Elizabeth becomes more complicated. Further complicating things is the arrival of the Jennings' new neighbour, FBI agent Stan Beeman, who is part of a new division of the agency tasked with fighting foreign agents on U.S. soil.::Jwelch5742"
