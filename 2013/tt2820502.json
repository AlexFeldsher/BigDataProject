The three-episode pilot story arc focuses on the midnight release party for a popular trading card game that Becca is compelled to host at the shop. But the event is destined for disaster as Becca, Tom and the Altered Egos regulars all try to mix their social lives with their gaming lives - with explosive results. Infinite Issues is the latest project from Mongrel Studios (The Roomies, Really Good Reaosn), created by Jared Yanez and Quinn Allan and developed with Jeff Hammond and Zach Carter.",
