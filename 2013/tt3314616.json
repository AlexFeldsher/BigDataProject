He initially took up small films roles, landing him on the sets of various well-known silent movies. After starring in The Sheik he instantly became a superstar and a sex symbol of the 1920s, known as the \"Great Lover\". Women went crazy for his dark, mysterious look, and the wanton way the sheik treated the heroine. His life was characterized by success, love, and personal disasters. Valentino's reputation was also enhanced by his arrest for bigamy. After marrying the wrong woman he met the love of his life, Natacha, but failed to wait for his divorce to be finalized before remarrying. Another humiliation came when Natacha left him heartbroken, moving to France and divorcing him. Valentino died unexpectedly at the age of 31 leaving the nation in shock while his early and tragic death contributed to his status as an icon of the silver screen.",
