            "For over a decade, Jason Abrams has been the Jerry Maguire of real estate, responsible for buying and selling homes worth millions of dollars for pro-athletes. Jason's life provides a behind-the-scenes look into the intense world of pro-sports real estate. A dedicated, 24/7 working machine, Jason is equal parts real estate agent, concierge and tour guide as well as marriage and credit counselor for the athletes he and his team serve. Scoring the Deal, has a similar premise to other real estate-themed reality television shows such as Selling New York, Million Dollar Listing and House Hunters. During the first season, Jason Abrams and his partner Kristen Cook handle real estate deals for pros such as former NFL running back Clinton Portis, Indianapolis Colts star Vontae Davis and San Francisco 49ers tight end Vernon Davis. The team travels across the entire country to meet with their athlete clients and spend days researching all the current available properties in their price range, then the client will see only the \"best in show\" and choose their favorite property."
