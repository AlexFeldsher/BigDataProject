Aonuma Kiryu is a genius interviewer who is able to get people to loosen their tongues. Shirakawa who takes pleasure in being a fake, has become the transforming interviewer Aonuma Kiryu in order to listen to what people say. He has no interest in the truth but seeks a real case which he had found through the internet as subject matter for his 100th novel. It is the unsolved Tulip Murders in which the grotesque abandoned corpses of two housewives were followed by yet another murder one year later. Together with a pretty editor, Shirakawa heads to the town where the cases occurred. As Aonuma, he gets close to the hidden truth with his formidable powers of deduction.",
