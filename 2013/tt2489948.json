Rosewood Plantation, located on the outskirts of New Orleans, has a new \"guest\", a skeptical curator intent on debunking the \"urban legends\" that have been spoken of often, but only in whispers, by the local townsfolk for decades. In Season One, his faith in science and is put to the test as he feels compelled by \"otherworldly\" forces to uncover the truth about the dark secrets woven into the very fabric of this South Louisiana plantation. What is revealed about the paranormal activity occurring at Rosewood Plantation and its origins pushes the curator to his psychological and emotional limits.
