            "From Nostradamus and the ancient Mayans to modern-day scientists, the theoretical apocalypse has been the source of endless speculation and countless predictions, with anything from super-volcanoes to mega-tsunamis, rogue planets or a massive methane eruption leading to the so-called end of life as we know it. In this series, some of the worlds leading scientists, along with elaborate computer graphics, illustrate the different what if? theories of if and how catastrophic weather or natural disasters could possibly cause the end of days or transform our lives forever.\n(Source: The Weather Channel)"
