        "plot outline": "39-year old Sakura Toyama is a hairdresser and salon assistant manager, who is concerned by her stagnant life. She has just been passed over for the manager position, which has instead been given to Rintaro Tachibana, an old male friend with whom she constantly bickers, she hasn't dated in ten years and her only social life is her girl outings with her two best friends, Miki and Shima. Even if she can't do much to better her professional situation, Sakura decides to at least do something about her love life. She accepts a party invitation from Chiyoko Ogami, a regular at the salon. At the party, she meets 24-year old BMX-cyclist Hiroto Saeki, who claims to be interested in her. The two start dating, but what Sakura doesn't know is that Hiroto is Chiyoko's stepbrother, and that Chiyoko paid him to date her in order to keep her away from Rintaro, whom Chiyoko is obsessed with. Hiroto soon starts falling for Sakura for real, but what will happen when she finds out the truth about how they met? And how does Rintaro really feel about Sakura? Meanwhile, Shima gets dangerously close to Miki's husband, and Miki feels trapped by her passionless marriage and her intrusive mother-in-law.",
