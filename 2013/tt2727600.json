            "One bar. One night. Ten single people. Welcome to Mix, a high-end bar in Manhattan's trendy meat-packing district and the backdrop for a sexy new highconcept comedy from the writers of THE HANGOVER. Recently dumped by his fiancé, Tom (Blake Lee) hasn't been out on the town in a decade. His best friends, handsome and confident Cal (Craig Frank) and fasttalking Bruce (Andrew Santino), are throwing Tom back into the dating pool whether he likes it or not. Tom's first encounter is with Maya (Mercedes Masohn), an attorney who's as beautiful as she is brutal. Before long, Tom is in tears. After that, it only gets worse. Rounding out Mix's chic crowd is Maya's engaged-for-now friend Liv (Kate Simses); aggressive single mom Jessica; her younger, naive sister Janey; bubbly cocktail waitress Kacey (Vanessa Lengies); dark, mysterious bartender Dominic; and failed internet entrepreneur Ron (Adam Campbell), who's drunk and having the worst night of his life. Each episode will highlight two characters meeting for the first time. The pilot focuses on Tom meeting Maya, but across the course of this one night - and the entire season - each of our five guys will meet each of our five girls. Will they find love? Will they find a warm bed for the night? Will they find a cold drink in their face? All questions will be answered by the season finale of this highly intoxicating new comedy. Executive produced by Ryan Seacrest & Nina Wass, written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (THE HANGOVER, 21 AND OVER), and directed by Larry Charles (SEINFELD, ENTOURAGE, BORAT)."
