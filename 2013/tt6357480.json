When the Anti-Japanese War breaks out, Zhang Zhaoyin from Zhang village becomes a traitor, and helps Kameda and his force enter the two villages easily. The Japanese troops build gun turrets and plunder food in the two villages, making villagers suffer a lot. After knowing what Japanese troops have done, Jia Wenjin and Zhang Zhaoxi who are defeated in Kuomintang battlefield feel extremely angry. Thus, they form their own anti-Japanese force named White Horse Regiment and Black Horse Regiment. Jia Wenbai, an art troupe commander of the Eighth Route Army, is designated to come back to the villages to spy on the enemy, and develop armed force in enemy's rear area. Thus, Jia Wenbai integrates Jia Wenjin's anti-Japanese force and Jia Wencan's special detachment. They cooperate with Jia Wenqing, the president of Peacekeeping Organization, attacking enemy in organization. Meanwhile Zhang Zhaoyin realizes his error and decides not to work for Japanese any more. He also joins the anti-Japanese force. At last, under the command of the Eighth Route Army, villagers of Zhang and Jia destroy the gun turret and defeat Japanese force together.",
