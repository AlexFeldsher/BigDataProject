Utilizing the footage they record, the footage they discover, and in the case of Claire's torturous Snuff Movie stalker, the footage they inspire. Claire and co. are solving a puzzle fueled by the facts of video. If it's not on tape, it's like it never happened. Their hunt for answers will take them from the eerie small towns of Ohio, to Roanoke Island, with all the monsters that live in the darkness, from perverted slender men, to pure evil itself incarnate, proving themselves real along the way.",
