            "Comedian Nazeem Hussain is host and star of Legally Brown, where he performs his unique brand of stand up to frame a series of socially relevant character and hidden camera stunts, as well as scripted comedy sketches. This anarchic series parodies many aspects of Australian life, including race relations, politics and pop culture. Highlights include Uncle Sam, a taxi driver turned politician who is on the campaign trail make Australia Halal, Imran Farook, a TV mystic healer who uses unconventional techniques on his unsuspecting guests, and The Prince of Mumbai, who has traveled to Australia to find a wife! Audiences will be privy to Nazeem, an outspoken Muslim whose parents emigrated from Sri Lanka to Australia, who is known for making fun of his own experiences growing up, as well as the white Australian population."
