        "plot outline": "The pilot opens with Edward driving along the interstate toward New Hampshire. As he drives, Edward revisits his morning. At work in a typical urban office building, Edward considers his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Jenna with whom he's just called things off. Brought out of his reverie by an exchange with his manager, a despondent Edward stares out his office window. Edward hears a ping from his computer indicating someone has just posted a link to his social networking account. Edward clicks the link, and it takes him to the Misty Mountain commune's website. After his boss pesters him again, Edward explores Misty Mountain's rudimentary and poorly-constructed webpage. There, he finds images of the commune and rants about communal life, organic farming, and sustainability. Edward watches a few roughly produced videos on the site and, amidst a constant stream of pop-up invitations, gradually begins to think of moving there for a week to clear his head. After an exchange with a co-worker, Edward sees his manager haranguing another employee. Using this as a distraction, Edward strolls out of the office, all the while checking over his shoulder, waiting for someone to stop him. Exiting the office building, Edward fields a call from his Alumni Association calls asking for money, and this final indignity causes Edward to destroy his phone. Edward's flashback ends as he crosses the New Hampshire state line.",
