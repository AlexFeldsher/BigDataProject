        "plot outline": "In the late Qing Dynasty, Tang Ziyi, Gu Renyi, and Suo Zhiyi are sworn brothers. They are bandits at first and then become righteous men who eliminate the rich bullies in the eastern Liaoning Province. At the beginning of the Republic of China, they join the Northeast Army, and begin to fight against Japanese who invade China's territory and oppress Chinese people. Although China is feeble at that time, Chinese soldiers are brave and powerful. They successfully defeat Japanese many times. After the \"September 18th Incident\", thousands of Northeast Army soldiers enter Shanhaiguan. The three men lead their forces to the mountains and begin guerrilla warfare with Japanese force. This story is all about ups and downs. The relationships between those characters are complicated and intertwined. Besides, the patriotic spirit demonstrated in this drama is very touching. How will the three brothers choose between brotherhood and love affairs? How will they choose between personal interests and national interests?",
