            "Washington, D.C. is the home to some of the most ambitious, young professionals, and also the most ridiculous displays of political flimflammery. Cap South is a show about both.Anyone who has ever worked in, near, or around our nations capital knows its teeming with crazy characters: the egomaniacs, the bleeding hearts, the cynics, and the ones who simply hope to make it through to the next self-inflicted so-called crisis. Combine them with any kind of actual power or authority and something interesting is bound to happen. Named after the metro station just feet from the U.S. House of Representatives office buildings, Cap South is an exaggerated version of this reality that focuses on the shenanigans that occur within just one dysfunctional congressional office. Complete with frustrating constituent phone calls, encounters with intimidating special interests, hyper-aggressive attack ads, awkward office romance, and the challenges of naming a post office, one thing is for sure this aint no Schoolhouse Rock!"
