She reluctantly agrees in the hope that doing so will help the siblings reunite with their long lost mother. As if living under the same roof with her male band mates isn't enough, her struggle to keep her identity a secret is further complicated by lead vocalist, Huang Tai-Ching (Jiro Wang), who could not be more displeased with her arrival.",
