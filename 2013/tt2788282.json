Specialty cameras will be mounted on everything, from surfers braving the waves to the helmets of active Army Parachute Specialists, as they rain down from over 12,000 feet above the boardwalk at the annual Atlantic City Air Show. We'll go behind the scenes and meet the world famous candy makers as they go through 10,000 pounds of taffy a day trying to satisfy tourists' insatiable sweet tooth! And just when you think you've seen it all, viewers will get an insider entrée to the country's last Circus Sideshow at Coney Island's Boardwalk - with never-before-given access to the sword swallowers, sorcerers, fire-eaters and more! From the sinfully delicious foods and adrenaline-pumping thrill rides, to the unexpected nearby attractions and miles of gorgeous beach - this will be an all-access pass to summer's most sizzling destinations, and the inside scoop on what makes these playgrounds the ultimate summer hotspots.",
