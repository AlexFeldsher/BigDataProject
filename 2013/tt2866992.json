            "Jack Gamble (Jack Gamble) investigates a series of objects or scenarios in short internet-broadcast episodes. The series utilises a mix of dark and awkward humour derived from the investigation subjects, which are frequently mundane or uninteresting. With the main character being a fictionalised representation of himself, Jack Investigates seems to be set in the real world, but sometimes strays from this probability. Jack's descriptions are stilted and bizarre, and there seems to be something very dark in his history. It is unclear whether Jack is deliberately creepy, or simply unintelligent and therefore unaware.There is little real educational value in Jack Investigates, which is another source of humour. It is a parody of educational shows and their too-happy presenters. The episodes follow a formulaic structure of introduction, investigation, audience inclusion, and conclusion, but have no apparent coherent plot."
