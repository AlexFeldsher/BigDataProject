        "synopsis": [
            "Baseball might be America's favorite pastime, but for the Gannon family it's also in their blood. Terry Gannon Jr. (Psyche's Maggie Lawson) was an All Star Softball player until life threw her a couple curve balls: a baby, a lost college scholarship and a loser for a husband. After striking out on her own, Terry heads home with her son Danny (Griffin Gluck) in tow and moves in with her estranged father, Terry Sr. aka The Cannon (James Caan). The Cannon is an opinionated, beer-guzzling, ex-athlete who never quite made the cut as a single father or professional baseball player. Terry is determined to make her temporary stay back home as brief as possible and immediately sets out to find a job and keep Danny as far away from the Cannon's bad influences as possible. As hard as Terry tries to keep Danny away from the sports-driven lifestyle of her youth, Tommy has shown an interest in playing youth baseball for the first time in his life. Terry soon discovers that his new interest in baseball is not because of the Canon's influence, but rather to impress a girl at his new school. Always the supportive mom, Terry reluctantly agrees to let him try-out for the team, but unfortunately the Gannon legacy of stellar athletic ability appears to have skipped 3rd generation Danny. His stunning lack of baseball skills (he doesn't even know which hand the mitt goes on) makes him the laughing stock of the baseball field. . .and his grandfather's living room. When Danny and a group of other athletically-challenged hopefuls fail to make the team, Danny's disappointment forces Terry to face her past. Even though she vowed never to let baseball dominate her life again, she wants her son to be happy. So when a wealthy neighbor volunteers to finance a separate team for the rejected kids, Terry reluctantly steps up to the plate and offers to coach the team of misfits. This funny, heartwarming comedy comes from the producing team of Mark and Robb Cullen (LUCKY, LAS VEGAS), John Requa and Glenn Ficarra (BAD SANTA, CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE) and Aaron Kaplan (THE NEIGHBORS)."
