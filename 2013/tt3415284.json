On land, Jules explores Derry's central role in the battle revealing how the city was the site of the USA's first military foothold in Europe in1941. With local historian Richard Doherty, Jules visits the site where the US set up 'Base One' at Beech Hill. Little more than a perimeter fence and a some wartime 'nissen huts' now remain of what was once the location for a base that barracked hundreds of American soldiers, ammo dumps and supplies. Presenter Jules Hudson said: \"From the sea bed off the coast of Ireland we have gathered images of ships and submarines that have lain lost and caught in a moment of time for over 70 years.

Without the endeavour of its prosecution, and the success of its outcome, it remains doubtful that the allied cause could ever have continued. Certainly the liberation of Europe would have taken a very different form, if it happened at all. For me, it has been an enormous privilege to play a part in adding to the commemoration of a campaign that has fascinated me since I was a boy.\" The dive team goes on the hunt for a U-Boat regarded as Hitler's most deadly submarine - one that some thought could've turned the Battle back in Hitler's favour had a new fleet of these super subs been launched.
