            "When you move in with your parents after your divorce, you tell yourself it's not forever. Even if you're living with crazy, you can survive it. Because, it's only temporary. Polly (Sarah Chalke) is a single mom who's been divorced for almost a year. The transition wasn't easy for her, especially in this economy. So, like a lot of young people living in this new reality, she turned to her parents for a little help. Polly and her daughter Natalie have moved back home with her eccentric parents, Elaine (Elizabeth Perkins) and Max (Brad Garrett), a couple who are full of life, which seems to always collide with hers. And after a year, it kind of feels like a life sentence. Polly's determined to be \"the best single working mother in the Universe\", the mom she never had, and so far it hasn't been a cakewalk. Polly and her parents look at life through two different lenses. Polly's too uptight. Her parents are too laid back. Polly's conservative when it comes to dating (no action, whatsoever), while her parents are still sexually adventurous. Polly's trying to have perfect parenting skills, while her parents are more relaxed. They think Polly turned out okay, so what's the big deal. Well, they say it takes a village to raise a child... and in Polly's case, this village is on fire. But with help from her best friend Gregg (the one that got away) and her lovable yet irresponsible ex-husband Julian (the one who wants her back), Polly takes her first steps toward getting a life, starting with a social one. From executive producers Claudia Lonow (Less Than Perfect, Accidently on Purpose, Cashmere Mafia), Brian Grazer (Arrested Development, 24, Parenthood, Friday Night Lights), and Francie Calfo (The Playboy Club, Scoundrels), comes a contemporary new comedy about what it takes to start over. Sometimes you need to move home, in order to move on"
