            "Wannabe pop sensation Jack Hooper cant understand why nobody in school appears to recognise his incredible musical talent. For now, his biggest fan is also his best friend and loyal manager, Gilbert. When a magical portal to a supernatural dimension opens up in his rehearsal room and two extraordinary girls drop in - a fairy called Violette and Gina, a witch - Jack reckons that with their help his dreams of stardom may at last become a reality."
