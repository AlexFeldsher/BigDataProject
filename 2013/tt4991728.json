        "synopsis": [
            "Snapatoonies is filled with a range of exciting characters and a variety of themes. It maximizes learning opportunities through clever repetition and viewer participation, making the show standout in both quality and parental acceptance.Snapatoonies is the perfect antidote to the fast-moving images and loud sounds that compete for a child's attention. We all need quiet moments in the day, and this recently developed, unobtrusive animation series will draw young viewers into the amazing, colourful world that we all inhabit. This is a series full of fun characters, interesting questions, entertaining answers, and underlined by the creators innate belief in the incredible ability of children to learn anything.The five kids on the Snapatoonies train roll along through all the episodes, yelling out answers along the way. Whether they are dancing with Jurassic Joe, or balancing on a branch with Timmy Toucan, the Snapatoonies kids provide the right answers and prompts, as well as encourage participation from even the youngest of viewers.Different characters host and narrate each episode, with the Snapatoonies kids on the train forever present. With characters like the wisecracking Timmy Toucan, Abby Apple, Ernie Easel, and even talking snowflakes, every episode covers a wide variety of topics. The narratives are original, enchantingly simple, and enriched with music, laughter, and children's voices.\\Snapatoonies explores the relationship between narrator and child, rather than presenting a performance for a passive audience. Children, parents, and carers alike, will recognise Snapatoonies as similar to how one reads to a small child - complete with all the usual interruptions, sidetracks, comments, and questions!"
