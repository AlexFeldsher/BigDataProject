            "Belteus chronicles the adventures of a fat guy and his talking belt....who hates him! Clark, the fat guy doesn't think he's fat. Belteus, the talking belt will tell you differently. Clark buffoons his way through the day and longs for his next meal. Belteus is pushed to his limits three times a day plus snacks. Meal time is a smorgasbord of banter that will make you laugh and think twice about what you're going to order for lunch. Clark's roommate and friend from Papua New Guinea, Mahmootay is a cannibal who often dreams of eating the fat guy. Clark has a fat girlfriend named Lola who has talking twin stilettos, Stella and Bella. One twin is nice, the other...not so much. And if that is not enough Clark's microwave is the nemesis of Belteus. When that microwave timer is running, Belteus gets nervous. A fat guy and his talking belt....that hates him!"
