Gina Keatley says mushrooms, which are packed with vitamin D and selenium, can help boost an immune system. Tea also offers the proper antioxidants to help boost the immune system. Additionally, lemon and honey contain antiviral properties. Shellfish is a good type of food to eat because it contains zinc, iron and protein. Keatley says aside from eating healthy, people should get a flu shot. It's also important to frequently wash your hands.    "
