            "16 major universities around the country debate to be the national debate champion. Moderated by Javier Solorzano, these students will have to debate and confront direct elimination. The teams don't know the topic of debate until a week before the debate. Positions are prepared \"for\" and \"against\" the topic by each team. Each team then picks and envelope that reveals the position they're going to debate. The winning team, will take the title and 30 computers for their campus. Jos√© Merino, Ana Paula Cinta and our guest judge, will determine every week who the better team is, advancing them to the next round. Teams are judged based on facts, strategy and presentation. The debate consists of five phases. At the end, votes are counted and averaged, the winner is announced, and then, each team reveals their true position on the topic they debated."
