        "plot outline": "Just like any other married guy, Leandro Alcuar longs for a child but, unfortunately, his wife Bessie, cannot give him one. Supporting the business and living with Bessie is her cousin Ofelia Almazan. Because of her husband's death, Ofelia single-handedly raised her daughter Lizzie. Ofelia devoted her life to Lizzie, but the latter eventually dies because of heart failure. On the other side of the story is Janet Perez, a cunning woman who deeply admires Leandro because of his looks and wealth. Ambitiously wanting Leandro's attention, she viciously schemed to have a child with him. When she was about to tell Leandro the news that she is pregnant, Janet finds out that Bessie is also pregnant. In memory of Ofelia's daughter, Bessie will name her child Lizzie, who will also eventually die because of an accident. Janet decides to go abroad and leaves her child Lara, together with a letter, in front of the house of Leandro. Unfortunately, it is Ofelia who first sees Lara and reads Janet's letter. Longing for a child, Ofelia decides to keep Lara and lies to Leandro and Bessie about the true identity of the child. Another twist comes in when Janet, now married to a rich Japanese businessman, comes back and tries to get Lara back.",
