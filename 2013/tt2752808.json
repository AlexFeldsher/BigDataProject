Over-shadowed commercially by the high-price purchases of their closest geographical rivals, the Mariners venture headfirst into the season as defending minor-premiers. But their best kept secret - the Yellow Army of supporters and the 'marquee' fan base - may be enough to pull the community-centric team through the challenges of the season and emerge at the summit of A-League success. 'The Code' follows the team through the 28 weeks of competition with the community, personalities and culture of the organization all providing vital cogs in the story of the Mariners. More than a football series, 'The Code - Life With The Mariners' is a story of conquering adversity, a fight against the odds with a unique team in an equally intriguing community. 'The Code' shines light on the club, its people and its places in a not-to-be-missed factual series, the first of its kind for football in Australia.",
