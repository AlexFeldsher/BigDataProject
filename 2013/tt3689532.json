We also discover how walking rehabilitation helped teenager Daniela recover from a sudden stroke, and how technology that once promised an easy future may now be harmful to your health. On the lighter side, the episode questions non-walkers on their excuses for sitting around, has fun encouraging people to get up and move with a viral video, and features short vignettes that celebrate the beauty of stepping outside.",
