That allows Dredd's human contracted thief Troy Winters and two henchmen to ambush their blinded transport and steal the case for Dredd, who however refuses to pay until it's rendered 'complete and operational'. That requires stealing alien technology from MTech's vault. Max Steel must get it back, despite Elementors on the road, so they try motorcycle mode.    "
