Having to take the subway to and from work at late hours, Sliwa became fed up with the crime rate and lack of safety for passengers. He banded with a group of friends to begin weapons-free volunteer patrols of the New York City subways. With their signature red berets and red jackets, The Guardian Angels are now recognized worldwide as icons representing community safety, education, and youth development. This reality series follows the Guardian Angels as they patrol dangerous neighborhoods in New York and other cities.",
