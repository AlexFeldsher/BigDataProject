To insure its success, they decide to sponsor a contestant for the beauty pageant 'Miss Korea', hoping that she'll win and that will help promote the product at large. For that, they need to find a beautiful woman willing to go into the pageant with newcomers like them, so Hyung Joon turns to Oh Ji Young, his high school sweet heart who he broke up 10 years before, and not in the best of terms at that. Ji Young isn't very happy to see him again, but her own dissatisfaction with her job and her life make her reconsider.",
