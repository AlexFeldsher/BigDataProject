Elizabeth wants to go to her new job at the FBI when she is picked up by them and driven to a black-site to meet Raymond Reddington, a master criminal who vanished a long time ago and came back as the concierge of crime. After eluding capture for decades, he turns himself in, but only agrees to speak to Elizabeth Keen. He wants to help the FBI capture dangerous criminals, some of them unknown to the FBI. A task force is created. However, there remains some questions. What is Reddington's connection to Elizabeth? Why does he want to solve cases with the FBI? Is Elizabeth's husband Tom who he pretends to be? These questions are slowly resolved when the team go through people on Reddington's Blacklist.::CPDE",
