            "_Yukon Gold_ (qv) follows four gold mining crews who have only four short months in Canada's wild Yukon to earn one BIG payday. With the price of gold hovering at record-breaking levels, a modern day gold rush is underway. One good strike makes a man rich - one bad season takes him down for good. Battling mechanical breakdowns, the elements and 18-hour days under the midnight sun, these competitive diehards have gold fever - and it keeps them coming back year after year for another chance to wager it all.::Paperny Entertainment"
