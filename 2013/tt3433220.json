Eli has a twin brother name Jacob; and Klinton is the oldest brother, Haha is the adopted brother and Pops is their father. Old Man is POPS brother. Eli and his family runs a mortuary. A seasoned police detective and his CSI team know that the strings of horrific murders happening at a certain time of year are more related than the date they share. Despite vastly different weapons and victims, they know that the killers are connected. Unfortunately, they are the only ones to think so. Only a few more pieces of the puzzle are needed to put a name to the killers. That also means waiting for the anniversary and all the carnage that will come. Meanwhile, a morbid family ritual is about to begin. This time, however, drugs and past successes have made these hunters sloppier than their kin. This time, the bloody trail will lead to answers.",
