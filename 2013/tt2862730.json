Characters may or may not \"match\" their respective sonnet. Some will work; others will not. The goal is to release a new one every weekday\nin no particular order - until I've read every single one of them. And to have fun along the way.tl;dr Shakespeare's sonnets filtered through the mind of a voice actor."
