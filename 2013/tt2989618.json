        "plot outline": "BELLE GUNNESS' FARM focuses on a small housing development in suburban Indiana with one horrific secret in common... all were built on the property of a prolific female serial killer! Two families and two professional ghost hunters encountered spine-tingling encounters with a hostile female spirit - a bloodthirsty ghost intent on killing from beyond the grave. A key witness includes a young child who saw the ghost of the killer - and the ghosts of her victims. A credible ghost hunter and spiritualist seeks to give the families relief by confronting the spirit... unleashing a maelstrom of supernatural phenomenon in a basement where the ghost once lured men to their death. Will his bravery give the young suburban families peace? SAN PEDRO SAILOR is a story fraught with sexual obsession... that transcends death! A young, attractive single mother moves into an historic home in the coastal town of San Pedro, CA, but finds her new home already has an occupant, a jealous, domineering ghost! After she, her child and her neighbor are terrorized by spectral harassment, she contacts a renowned team of investigators. Within a short time, the ghost attempts to kill the team's main cameraman via a \"hanging\". As the incidents - including dripping blood and destruction of property - grow more intense and unpredictable, the woman moves away. The ghost FOLLOWS her, never leaving her alone. After a spectacular SEANCE (which once again nearly costs the cameraman his life), the team discovers the answers to the ghost's identity. Can they use these hard-won facts to banish the ghost from their lives? In a violent confrontation in an investigator's Los Angeles apartment, they attempt to do just that!",
