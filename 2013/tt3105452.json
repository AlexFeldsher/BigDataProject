            "Following an accident that left him with severe memory loss, Banri Tada is determined to start a new life by leaving his hometown to study at a Tokyo law school. He immediately struggles to adjust to city life and is late for his university orientation. By chance, he meets Mitsuo Yanagisawa, a classmate who also missed his orientation. The pair quickly become friends, but Banri soon meets Kouko Kaga, a childhood friend of Mitsuo's who proclaimed her undying love for him, despite Mitsuo rejecting her obsessive advances. Banri falls in love with Kouko, who later reciprocates his feelings. However, Banri's past comes back to haunt him as memories return to him and he fears his old self will replace his current self. He discovers that Linda, a fellow university student, was his closest friend in high school who he had once been in love with. Banri realises that should all his memories return, he will be in love with Linda again, and could no longer be with Kouko. With this knowledge, his and Kouko's relationship becomes increasingly tense. Eventually, Kouko realises that she must leave Banri, who she knows will revert back too his former self and wish to be with Linda. After a later incident, Banri regains all his memories, but loses all recollection of his time at Tokyo, forgetting his friends and Kouko. He returns to his hometown, staying away from any indication of his university life. One day, a stranger comes to his door, returning an object to him. Banri suddenly remembers his university days, and recognises the stranger as Kouko. He pursues her and proclaims his love for her, leaving his past behind for his new life."
