            "Its time Reno TV got Punkd!The Fix is Candid Camera meets Face Lift in this reno-ridiculous half hour of comedy meets\ncraftsmanship for HGTV. Each week, irreverent and infectiously funny Brit contractors Jay Purvis (Kitchen\nEquipped) and Neil Davies (Real Renos) prey on hapless homeowners who think theyre getting a free TV\nmakeover, only to be fixed with some of the most absurd reno and decor ideas ever imagined.The Fix is a chance for these two talented craftsmen to ditch their measuring tapes and have some fun at their clients expense, showing us just how bad a reno can go, with priceless results. We watch the entire process as Jay and Neil scheme to deliver the ultimate practical joke, with someone elses house! In each episode, one story is introduced, the homeowners hopes and dreams for a makeover of a room in their home are explored, and then their worst nightmares are revealed to them by Jay, Neil and their evil crew. As the homeowners reveal their true feelings about the absurd transformation, our tireless pranksters keep straight-faced as long as possible, describing and defending their pièce de résistance, until the homeowner is finally informed Youve been fixed, messed with, this is all a joke!After the fake room is revealed, and some CPR administered, all is forgiven (we hope!) and our guys make it all right - fixing the mistakes, and pulling off the nasty finishings, revealing the beautiful space our good-sport\nhomeowners were hoping for. The homeowners are ushered back into the space for the real reveal and after hugs and kisses, its on to the next victim, er, homeownerThe 26 half hour episodes of season one will be as visually unique as the concept itself. Super-8 home movie\nstyle treatments will be used for family b-roll and the shooting style throughout will be hand-held, fast and\nimmediate. The Fix will be peppered throughout with an infectious modern musical style keeping the entire feel fresh, fun and cool.The Fix is a daring and hilarious experiment in home reno TV, and shows us just how far two seemingly honest, skilled contractors will go for a really good laugh at their clients expense."
