            "Set in late 1890s Toronto, _Murdoch Mysteries_ (qv) explores the intriguing world of William Murdoch (Yannick Bisson, Sue Thomas F.B. Eye), a handsome young detective using radical forensic techniques for the time, including fingerprinting and trace evidence, to solve some of the city's most gruesome murders. Though his unconventional approach elicits skepticism from his boss, Inspector Brackenreid (Thomas Craig, Coronation Street), Murdoch is often the only one who can crack the case. Murdoch's small circle of confidantes includes pathologist Julia Ogden (Hélène Joy, Durham County), a staunch ally who shares the detective's fascination with forensic science, and Constable George Crabtree (Jonny Harris, Hatching, Matching and Dispatching), Murdoch's eager but inexperienced right-hand man. Both are valuable allies who help Murdoch solve his varied cases and traverse the many stratums of Victorian society. The fourth season will throw some difficult challenges Detective Murdoch's way. To start, pathologist Dr. Julia Ogden, who departed for a new job at the Children's Hospital of Buffalo at the end of season three, may have found a compelling reason to stay in Buffalo. Her replacement, brought in from Scotland Yard - the ill-tempered Dr. Francis (Paul Rhys) - will clash frequently with the even-tempered Murdoch. In other episodes, an old flame from Bristol, England, Anna Fulford (Lisa Faulkner), will return to pay Murdoch a visit under tragic circumstances; a crime spree will lead to a Gypsy camp and a mysterious \"wise woman\" (Lisa Ray); and mysterious Canadian spy Terence Meyers (Peter Keleghan) will once again show up as Murdoch investigates a case that hearkens back to the American Civil War and could threaten Canadian-American relations; Murdoch gets helps from the butler (Simon Williams) when a wealthy businessman is murdered and his son, Nicholas Jenkins (Craig Olejnik) is questioned; and in the season finale a wedding will take place...but who will be walking down the aisle?::Shaftesbury Films"
