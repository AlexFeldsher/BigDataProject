            "When a satellite crashes near the remote Utah town of Piedmont, it becomes apparent that it may be carrying a deadly virus. All but two of the town's inhabitants, a baby and a Sterno drinker, are dead. Working in a secret government laboratory deep underground, Dr. Jeremy Stone leads a team of scientists who try to identify the virus and develop a means of stopping its spread. Several others, including the military and other senior government officials, have their own agendas however leading to the spread of misinformation about the origin of the virus.::garykmcd",
            "Two soldiers are sent to find a satellite that has crash-landed near a small town in Utah called Piedmont; but someone has removed it from where it landed. The soldiers make their way to town in order to find it. But what they find in \"the armpit of nowhere\" is unexpected and horrible. Dead bodies are lying about everywhere. Suddenly an old man runs up to their Humvee screaming for help. But it's too late - for the soldiers. Within moments they are stricken by something unknown. And then they're dead. Soon, Dr. Jeremy Stone will lead a crack team of scientists as they work feverishly in a secret, state-of-the-art laboratory to discover what has killed the citizens of Piedmont, and why two survivors seem to have been immune. They have little time. Whatever wiped out the people of the small town is spreading across the country and killing everyone in its path. Meanwhile, a rogue television reporter battles with sinister government agents to learn the truth about the disaster.::J. Spurlin"
