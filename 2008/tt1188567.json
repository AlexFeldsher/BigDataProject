Her determination to always be the first to get the news has given her fame and prestige -- as well as enemies. Ivy (Francine Prieto), Cassandra's number one rival, is determined to be better than Cassandra in every way possible. And she will do whatever is necessary to achieve her goals, and to own the heart of the man who only has eyes for Cassandra. But Cassandra remains unstoppable, not knowing her assertiveness and too much ambition will be what can lead her to tragedy that would change her entire world -- and even bring her to the brink of death. When she regains her consciousness after her accident, Cassandra also gains something different, something unnatural: the ability to communicate with the dead, whether she wants to or not. Will Cassandra embrace her new ability? Or will she run away from the new and extraordinary destiny waiting for her? Will she ever get to return to her normal life?",
