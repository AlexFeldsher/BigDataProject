Each of the culinary rivals has their own individual cookery style and is competing to produce the very best dish using the same main ingredient or theme. There are two challenges in each episode that are peppered with tips and hints. Anna, Ben and Darren create three very different twists on each theme and they are competing against each other. Each week, a different group of food-loving tasters judge which dish is the best. The three also offer invaluable tips on choosing, sourcing and cooking the ingredients. Anna's accessible, no-fuss approach to food suggests recipes that take the minimum of time, fuss, and cost, but still look good and taste great. Ben's global influences and passion for using the best ingredients mean his dishes are stunning yet simple to make. And Darren reveals restaurant secrets that will inspire you and impress your friends and family.",
