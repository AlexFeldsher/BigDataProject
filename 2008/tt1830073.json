            "Each month, host Lee Martin guides viewers through all-new tales of the macabre in this cult TV anthology. Noted for its tightly scripted tales peppered with sex, mystery and irony, the series has influenced many indie film producers since its September 6, 2008 debut and garnered a loyal fan-base of viewers hungry for its special brand of malice.The show's anthology format has allowed its creators to explore a wide range of themes, all of which share a final \"twist\" in their closing minutes before Martin returns to sum things up. Sometimes referred to as a hybrid between \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" and \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Lee Martin's The Midnight Hour\" has created for itself a brand as unique as its storytelling."
