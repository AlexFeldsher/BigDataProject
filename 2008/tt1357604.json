            "Wayne Carini continues to please his viewers with his sincere and passionate love of classic cars on his show. _Chasing Classic Cars_ (qv) is a great reality show with a valid story-line where the host seeks out repairs refurbishes and sometimes restores as needed to bring these classics to market. One of the many reasons that this show is so successful is Wayne Carini is dedicated to fair business practices and has an incredible knowledge of not only classic cars but rare exotic cars. Wayne Carrini was indoctrinated to the classic car business with his father \"Bob Carini'\" who' specialty was restoration of classic cars including Duesenberg's, Ford, Packard's and Lincolns. \"Reality Shows,\" that have substantially talented people always seem to be more successful than those where the producers are looking for shock value in foul language, low talent and tattoos which ultimately end up as being short lived. _Chasing Classic Cars_ (qv) has done and will continue to do well on the Discovery Channel since 2008 because the show content is always original and \"REAL!\" The episodes are interesting, well thought out and always an honest representation of the problems and the outcomes of the vehicle adventure. The weekly stories where we see the sellers, the buyers, his staff and professional relations encountered are always entertaining to watch. This show is a great look into the story of some very interesting classic cars, their history, their owners and ultimate outcome.::Martin Snytsheuvel"
