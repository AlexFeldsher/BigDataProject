            "Sensuality and drama intertwine in a breathtaking and humorous story. _Alice_ (qv) is a 26 year-old woman that lives a simple life in Palmas, a region of northern Brazil. After four years of dating Henrique, they decide to move in together, but her father s unexpected death changes everything, taking _Alice_ (qv) all the way to Sao Paulo, where she gathers with her stepmother, aunt, and sister. _Alice_ (qv) stays longer than planned, and she finds new loves and friends, awakening to a brand new world. In the middle of urban chaos, _Alice_ (qv) re-discovers the city, her country, and ultimately, herself."

        "synopsis": [
            "From Palmas, Alice brings to São Paulo a foreseeable future where everything is already set. She lost her mother when she was a sophomore in college, where she studied communications. She lives with her grandmother, Glícia, and her younger brother, Duda. After graduating, Alice works as a tour guide at the Palmas Office of Tourism. She is about to move in with her boyfriend, Henrique to a small apartment in downtown Palmas. The loss of her father will be the cause of a huge shift in Alice's well-planned future. Arriving in São Paulo, the stability of her existence is challenged as she is exposed to various paths and discovers that the world extends beyond the boundaries of Palmas. She is seduced and swallowed up by São Paulo. While getting lost in the city, Alice finds herself much more lost than she imagined. She winds up settling in the city, where she seeks to find herself, forever changing the course of her life.At the same time that Alice discovers the outlines of this city that welcomes and repels her, she undergoes a process of inner discovery of her identity, re-encountering the stories of a father whom she hardly knew and growing closer to a half-sister she wishes to get to know. The story's drama builds gradually, as Alice plunges into her still somewhat nebulous, rough and indistinct internal reality.At the end of this journey, Alice overcomes the obstacles that the city imposes on her and becomes a more confident and mature woman, affirming herself by achieving her independence, both financially and emotionally. As we accompany Alice on her experiences in São Paulo, we also get a glimpse of the everyday life of a restless metropolis - a cosmopolitan, contemporary, intense city that is the setting a character in our story. Soon we will be immersed in a delicate study of the human relationships that are established in this effervescent megalopolis.The series is a slice, a fragment, of this metropolis and its countless possibilities. Alice is just one more among many other anonymous souls in search of answers, love, and challenges. She is a young woman who wants to live life at full throttle, discover pleasures, chalk up successes and fearlessly face her failures.Contrary to most of the trends in Brazilian television dramas, where conflicts arise from elements extraneous to the characters, in this series the viewer will witness the internal reality of Alice and of the other characters through their inner conflicts. In this universe, there are no villains and no heroes.The series will cast a loving look at a world that is not built on a value judgment of its characters. There are no good or bad guys, just human beings, both good and bad. In this sense, São Paulo also plays an important role, as the place onto which Alice projects her feelings. Often, the city will be seen and felt from her point of view, thus revealing the leading character's state of mind."
