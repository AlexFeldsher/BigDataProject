Quickly befriended by gay, happily married TERRY and KAYLEIGH who works on the juice bar and thinks nature's awesome, Miriam attempts to put her life back together. No mean feat considering her personal trainer GEE is a steroid induced, one testicaled time bomb; The manager LORNA, a former Miss Melbourne, is pretty much Nurse Ratched in a tracksuit and her alternative therapist DAVID DARBLY, living in his office ever since his wife threw him out, is seriously in need of some, well, therapy. And then there's CONNOR, head of sales, the Irish charmer, who uses The Gym as his office, selling anything from pandas to petroleum. Fortunately protection exists in the shadowy form of EDUARDO, the Mexican cleaner/warrior, exiled from his village and sworn to protect one and all against injustice.
