            "Linkara is a witty, sarcastic young adult who reviews comic books of very poor detail, ranging from bad artwork to bad writing. Occasionally, characters from the comics as well as the comics themselves come to life and terrorize Linkara. Not only that, but other-worldly creatures often invade his house and try to take him hostage. He survives it all using his vast knowledge of comics and their many faults.::Anonymous"
