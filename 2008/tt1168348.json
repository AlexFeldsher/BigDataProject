Together with her two children, Isabel and Ignacio, first in Ardèche and then in Marsella, always brave, firm, and with a prodigious capacity to adapt, she will accept the help and the proofs of a society undermined by the default and the cooperation. Sixty years later, Isabel Esteva, a famous costume designer, presents in Paris her last fashion collection. She evokes the memories of this confused time; her brother when he entered the Pétain's militia at 17 because he was famine; her father died in October 1944, once back in Spain with some other thousand combatants to prepare an insurrection against general Franco. War, exile, oppression, expectancy always disappointing, and at the same time feeling renewed, for a better world. Life goes on.",
