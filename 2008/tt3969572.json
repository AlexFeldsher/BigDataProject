What is their recipe for avoiding monotony and yet are able to preserve harmony? They are caught exchanging tender glances, holding hands in the street and kissing discreetly. One day they fell in love and this love continues to this day... Through this collection of eight stories, we offer the viewer a similar perspective, full of emotion and humor. Each 12-minute episode is centered on a couple who tell their story through anecdotes about their love, their choices and compromises, during crises and those moments of doubt. The eight couples are from diverse socio-cultural background and different ages. Their stories are quite moving and they lead us to reflect on our own stories, through their happiness, their suffering, their loneliness and above all, their love. The stories of everyday life trace the course of events in the lives of these couples with whom we are pleased to share their unique experiences.",
