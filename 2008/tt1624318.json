Next is the core part of the interview: questions of the host himself. In the third part, which lasts a couple of minutes, Pozner asks questions he has complied from Marcel Proust's Questionnaire about one's personality. Then the guest leaves and in the final part, the epilogue, Vladimir Pozner shares with the audience his thoughts about an event, usually from the past week, and suggests us to think about it.",
