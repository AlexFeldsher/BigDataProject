In the 2000's he is a police detective in New York City, and after 400 years, knows just about everything about the way the criminal mind works.::Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com>",
            "In the 1600's the Dutch take over Manhattan island and during a massacre of native people, John Amsterdam (as he becomes known) saves the life of a woman, being wounded in the act. The woman uses her power as a shaman to heal him, and also imparts on him the power of eternal youth and immortality - at least until he meets his true love and becomes wed to her. At this point he will age normally and die eventually. In modern New York, John is a police detective who has a few people close to him that know his secret (old friends, literally) and tends to run into people who think they remember him from their own past.::Ron Kerrigan <mvg@whidbey.com>"
