The first English drama series filmed entirely overseas, it is a collection of four stories about Singaporeans abroad: living, working, traveling ... or simply lost. These four stories are connected by the central theme of Home and what it means to each of the characters. There's Meng, who's so taken by New Zealand during his secondment there that he decides to live there permanently. Then there's Chris and Linda, an expat couple living in Shanghai fighting over whether to have their baby in China or Singapore. And Stella, an eleven-year-old music prodigy on scholarship to a prestigious music academy in Budapest, trying to reconcile a new environment with the breakup of her parents' marriage. Finally, there's Marcus and Caroline, two Singaporeans long-settled in Siem Reap who have an awakening of sorts when they are trapped in a rural Cambodian village after an accident.",
