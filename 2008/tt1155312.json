            "The lives of four young people are intertwined because of love and obsession. Elsa Paruel (Nadine Samonte) is a travel agent who accidentally meets the architect Andy Abrigo (Polo Ravales). They are attracted to each other immediately but rich heiress Rosita Monteverde (Isabel Oli) wants to break up the couple so she can be with Andy. Rosita, who is obsessed with Andy, seduces him, leading to a one-night stand. When Rosita's father, Don Augusto (played by Juan Rodrigo), finds out about his daughter's affair with Andy, he sends the young man abroad. Afraid that Don Augusto will fire his mother, Aida (Dexter Doria) who works as the patriarch's secretary, Andy as no choice but to leave for the United States. But true love waits. After five years, Andy returns to the Philippines and rekindles his romance with Elsa and eventually they marry. Andy and Elsa's marriage leaves Rosita devastated and vengeful. Using her wealth and even her family friend Ernie Balboa (Carlo Aquino), who is in turn obsessed with her, Rosita steals Elsa's baby and makes it appear that the child died at birth. Elsa and Andy are distraught. After several years, Rosita comes back with Elsa's child, whom she named Adrian. Is stealing Elsa's child enough to end Rosita's vengeance or is it just the beginning of her evil plans for the couple? What if Elsa discovers her own obsession? Will she remain true and faithful to Andy? Is Andy's great love for Elsa enough to protect his family from Rosita's wrath? And will Ernie be able to find his much-needed space in Rosita's heart? Or will he end up being a scorned lover?::Anonymous"
