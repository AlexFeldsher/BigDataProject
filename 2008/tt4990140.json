        "plot outline": "Terrorists with an explosive and unimaginable agenda. One man with the key to understanding their true motive. But as the countdown begins, as each way out becomes an impasse, there's only one final approach left to stop them. One year ago Jack Bender was the most decorated hostage rescue specialist in FBI history. Then came the botched siege on the Utah compound of radical cult leader Silas Jansen. It left an innocent child dead, destroyed Jack's career, and put a strain on an already tenuous relationship with his estranged wife Alicia, employee of the Federal Aviation Administration. Now Jack's skills are unexpectedly challenged again when he finds himself aboard a domestic flight that's been hijacked by a man named Gilliad, head of a terrorist organization called People's Separatist Movement. The demand is the release of their leader Silas Jansen from prison. But the skies aren't the thing that the PSM has commandeered. Their far-reaching operatives have made additional moves by kidnapping a woman in Virginia, and in Maryland, a mother and her young daughter. The women, strangers bound in terror miles apart, have something else in common-both their husbands, high-powered bankers, are aboard the doomed flight. Jack begins to fear that the hijacker's motives extend beyond their radical beliefs. On ground, his suspicions are confirmed by Alicia when she discovers that Gilliad is a munitions expert with mad visions of nuclear grandeur. Unfortunately, there's only one way to stop him-by blowing the airliner out of the sky. Either way, the terrifying situation will be positively explosive.",
