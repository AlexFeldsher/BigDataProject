The contestants will be put through their paces to see who can turn the shaggiest pooch into a beautiful, prancing pup. These self-proclaimed best groomers will live together in a swanky Los Angeles loft, the Dog House; work elbow-to-elbow in one salon; and face grooming challenges that range from styling pups for their runway debut to grooming some of the most exotic dog breeds to making adoptable pups look their fetchingly best for new homes. After each challenge, host Jai Rodriguez and our outspoken panel of judges, including esteemed veterinarian Dr. Karen Halligan, champion dog handler Xavier Santiago and leading U.S. grooming expert Joey Villani will decide which contestant does not make the cut. The grand prize winner will receive a cash prize of $50,000, a mobile grooming salon from Wag'n Tails Mobile Grooming and the title of Groomer of the Year - three prizes totaling $125,000 that could jump-start the groomer's career and change their lives. Each of these groomers thinks he/she has what it takes to be top dog in this competition, but in reality, only one GROOMER HAS IT.",
