Augie makes clear his professionalism now takes precedence over Viv's craving for daily bed-gymnastics. Several couples wrestle with the delicate question whether to diplomatically overlook each-other's sexual past or openly share it, at the risk of starting spiteful shenanigans. Cyrus got a dog as babe-magnet from Elliott and reveals the vet is about to propose to Sara, which kindles irresistible jealousy in Bella.    "
