Dumped by his rich girlfriend and fired from the mail room at her father's law firm on the same day, Keith suddenly finds himself holed up in a tiny bachelor apartment, forced to fend for himself in the city of Los Angeles. Out of loneliness, desperation and pure boredom, Keith decides to shoot a web Vlog to document his attempts at getting himself together. Through the magic of craigslist, he enlists the talents of James (an inept yet overly confident, womanizing cameraman) to help him shoot this epic adventure. Step one in Keith's quest to become a fully functioning human being is to lay out a plan: 1.Get a job. 2. Get a car. 3. Get a cool girlfriend. But, as he ventures out in the city, he quickly realizes there are many obstacles standing between him and self actualization: Hard boiled cops obsessed with dealing out jaywalking tickets. Self important skinny-jean wearing hipsters who guard their turf with an iron fist and an ironic t-shirt. Tweaked out whack-a-doos who ride the #4 bus after midnight... and many more. In order to beat the odds, Keith will have to keep his wits about him and make the most of every available resource. No-one makes it alone in LA, and in Keith's case his allies come in the form of the fellow losers and underdogs of the city, whose assistance is often a double-edged sword.",
