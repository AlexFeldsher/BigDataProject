        "plot outline": "Andy Parks has been a part of Washington radio for over thirty years. He has worked as a disc jockey, music director, program director, operations manager, airborne traffic reporter and a morning show host. In fact, his first job required he read the 2 o'clock news, clean the studio and take out the trash. He's come a long way, but Patty, his wife of 30 plus years, still makes him take out trash. While majoring in accounting, data processing and computer programming Andy changed course and headed to the field of radio. His father claimed he would never be successful and this proved to drive him even harder. Along his career path he has been recognized for outstanding public service many times by our military, government agencies and community groups. He has played a significant role in raising tens of millions of dollars for Children's Hospital, The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Fisher House Foundation and others. Andy was nominated by the National Association of Broadcasters as \"Major Market Personality of the Year\" in 2007 and 2008. In July of 2011 he was named as the new Director of Radio Broadcasting for the Washington Times. His new show, \"Andy Parks, Live from the Washington Times airs locally on 730 am WTNT weekdays from 3-6pm.",
