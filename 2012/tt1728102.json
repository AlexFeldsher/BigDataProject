The show's premise is that both the prisoners and the guards disappeared in 1963 and have abruptly reappeared in modern-day San Francisco, where they are being tracked down by a government agency.::ahmetkozan",

To cover up the problem, the government reports to the public that the prison has been closed because of unsafe conditions. A secret government unit was set-up to find the prisoners. Now, in the present-day, the inmates begin returning - unaged and unaware of where they have spent the missing decades - and continue their criminal ways. They are acting out of character and appear to be searching for specific objects. A federal agent employs a police officer and a conspiracy theory novelist to help track them down.::Kad"

One by one, another specialized law-violator with a purpose is being seen in present-day San Francisco, where the newly recruited partnership of a dedicated law officer with an unusually skilled Alcatraz savant faces a plate full of secrets, violence, previously unknown scientific occurrences and interrelated, deep-rooted grudges by police, guards & criminals alike."
