            "Everyone of us has got at least one irrational fear ... in the case of Figaro Pho, he has them all. _The Adventures of Figaro Pho_ (qv) is a series about a warm-hearted, adorable, quirky and mischievous character ... who just happens to be afflicted with every phobia imaginable. He's afraid of vampires, toilets, mad dogs, aliens, and being stared at by a duck! He's also petrified of being alone, and so Figaro has created a mechanical companion - a dog-like robot he calls Rivet.::Anonymous"

        "synopsis": [
            "The Adventures of Figaro Pho tells the story of a character who has every phobia from A to Z. He lives in a mansion that is a death trap and the outside world is even worse. The series runs the gamut from hilarious to disgusting to surreal to scary (in a family friendly way).Figaro lives in a gothic mansion with a mechanical dog and best friend named Rivet. Every episode Figaro is met with a panic attack that is caused by the introduction of something into his life that instills fear. This can range from Relatives, to Unfamiliar Toilets, Old People to Mosquitoes. Some fears are more surreal like the Fear of Skin or the Fear of Duplication; others are more conventional like the Fear of Being Alone. Hilarious consequences arise as Figaro tries battle the fears. Re-occurring characters include a nosy mailman Cornelius who is forever meeting with an unfortunate fate; Dotty a Senior Citizen who seems to run everything from a sweatshop/general store, a grocery store and also appears to be a trained doctor; Boris , The Stinky Man - who tends to do odd jobs around the Pho mansion. Boris could probably benefit from pulling his pants up just slightly.\n"
