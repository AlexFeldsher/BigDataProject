Giving the show a 21st century twist, participants use handicams to record their own candid thoughts, feelings and opinions as well as introducing us to their refugee or migrant communities and navigating us through their, at times, contradictory worlds. The series presents a dynamic collection of surprising, funny and poignant personal stories about kiwis either living a culture clash or enjoying the best of both worlds. Prepare to laugh and cry with the unique and familiar in a documentary series that takes minority programming to another level. A switched-on and entertaining show that gives a voice to a vibrant and progressive group of young Kiwis with a foot in Both Worlds.",
