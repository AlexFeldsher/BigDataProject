        "synopsis": [
            "A story series set in Oorai where a young girl Miho Nishizumi has transferred from her old school, Black Forest Academy. This is mainly for helping a fellow tank girl on a course to win for the tenth time in a row. During this rugged test of wills, one of Miho's tanks had suddenly tipped over a ravine falling into a rough, and torrential river. Seeing as this does not sit well with her, decides to take the plunge and help her fellow student instead of finishing the game.This did not impress her mother who heads the school with her steely, and stern view on how a tank operator should act in the face of an enemy. Miho being ostracized soon after decides to leave Black Forest, and transfer to Oorai where she could just go to school and not worry about operating any more tanks in the near future. That is until the student council uses tactics to drag her back into Panzerfaren martial arts called Senshadou. At first Miho is not impressed by such dirty means, yet her new friends Hana, and Saori help her by calling out the councils bluff of expulsion. This had put Miho in a tight spot, and decides to join Senshadou to stop them from making too many mistakes.Now enrolled into the tank division, she and her new friends train together to start up the marital art, which was once abolished by the Oorai academy. With new students enrolling left and right, the school's division begins to rise up out of the ashes to take on all new comers, and neighboring schools, which are floating carrier cities on the ocean itself. However, because of mitigating circumstances in the school's budget, the head of the school board had announced to the council in secret that Oorai academy was to be shut down permanently if they can't boast new laurels to continue its curriculum in the near future.With this new secret held back from the girls, the student council puts on the pressure for Miho and her band of misfits to overcome the obstacles, which other schools are well known for in the battle field. Armed with a new resolve, Miho, and her companions train so hard, and diligently that they become the next ace in the hole to save the school. Faced with numerous overwhelming odds, they beat school after school in the semi-finals of The Senshadou competition held once a year until finally, the team of Oorai face Black Forest in the final round.Facing her sister Maho now, she knows how well trained black forest is on the field. Before Miho's transfer, her school has won nine times in the past as the best tank operators in Japan. Yet with her decision to help a student, lost to Pravda school in a final moment on the field where Miho abandons her group and jumps in the river to save her companions from a watery grave.This is why her entire platoon held her responsible for the loss, and why Miho left to search for a better life rather than using tanks to do so. In the end, she is still a tank girl deep down, but with her new friends in Oorai, has given her a new lease on life without the strict rules of the Nishizumi style of Panzerfaren. With Hana, Saori, Mako, Yukari on her side, these girls take it to the extreme when it comes to boasting their laurels on the field. Using their wits, training, practicing endless hours to hone their skills of radio operator, gunner, driver, loader, as well as commanding the entire platoon itself. Miho and her new found friends do not dwell on winning, they simply make sure that when you meet them on the field, you can have fun, blast away the competition, and make a mark in history as being the best team in the game.But for Maho, her view on the subject of winning no matter what causes a distance between both sisters. As news of the school's closure becomes public, Miho now turns her resolve into a crusade where all of her friends in the Oorai Platoon come together for that common goal, to win no matter what since the stakes just went up. With a new added on tank, her team of seven tanks come to eight on the field. Armed with just old world style tanks, Miho uses her unique savvy to outwit nearly all of the competition before the finals.Impressed by such audacity, Maho knows that her sister has now become an opponent not to be trifled with in any way. Although her Sub-commander Erika Itsumi dislikes Miho, knows not to oppose Miho because of the extreme training she's had by Black Forest in the past. With new friends, new school, new challenges, and above all great friends, Miho can stand by her choices to help those in need. Making this series one of the best in the top ten of funimation for the whole family."
