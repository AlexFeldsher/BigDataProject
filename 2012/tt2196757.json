            "A socially inept girl, Ririchiyo, seeks seclusion from others to attempt to improve herself and hence moves to a building that is rumoured to house the rich and powerful, when in fact it is meant for people with supernatural ancestors. Here, where it is seemingly normal to have a bodyguard, she is confronted by a very persistent agent with a very singular request; \"Make me your dog.\" A request she cannot seem to decline and hence their relationship starts to develop over time.::Mattias1"
