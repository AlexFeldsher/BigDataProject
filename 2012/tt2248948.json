            "The Seventh Art is an independently produced video magazine about cinema with profiles on interesting aspects of the film industry, video essays and in-depth interviews with filmmakers set in casual environments. Based in Toronto, Canada.We ask not only what is cinema, but when is cinema, where is cinema, how is cinema and why cinema, especially as media converges on new distribution models that are hopefully reflected in the cross-platform nature of our 'magazine'.The production is based out of Toronto, Canada and is presented in a deliberately unpolished state, eschewing the extensive editing and performative sheen of video programs on cinema that prioritize these elements above the discussion of cinema and the moving image broadly.\n"
