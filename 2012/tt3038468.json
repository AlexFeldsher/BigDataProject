Though devastated, the latter continues his life and begins to pursue his dreams. Through hard work and diligence, Alex fulfilled his long time dream of becoming a photo journalist. Here he crosses paths with Janice, an older woman, works as an editor-in-chief in one of the famous tabloids in the country. Janice manages her career with flying colors but such a failure when it comes to family matters [she craves for her husband's love and attention and battles to win her only daughter's affection]. On the other hand, Alex, being an unwanted child decided to carry out his vengeance plans against his biological father by becoming extremely successful. These two lonely souls finds solace in each other, and despite their age gap and social differences, prove that anyone can be bound in friendship. But their special friendship grows into an unlikely romance. Things get more complicated when Alex learns that Janice is Cindy's mother!",
