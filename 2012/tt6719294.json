Instead of nourishing us, what we eat and the way we produce it threaten the air we breathe, the water we drink and the dirt under our feet. And yet, too much 'food' television focuses on celebrity chefs and cooking competitions and not enough on where our food comes from and the impact it has on our planet, our country, our bodies, and our souls. Food Forward opens the door into a new world of possibility, where pioneers and visionaries are creating viable alternatives to the pressing social and environmental impacts of our industrial food system. Across the country, a vanguard of food rebels, farmers, chefs, fishermen, teachers, scientists, and entrepreneurs, are creating inspired, but practical solutions that are nourishing us and the planet. These are stories America needs to hear. This is Food Forward.",
