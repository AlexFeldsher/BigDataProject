            "An alleged Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker, Terry Goldman (Michael Hunter), has a dream of making the world's most entertaining documentary movie the world has ever seen. With inspiration from shows like \"Big Brother\" and \"The Amazing Race\", he decides to put together the world's most interesting people under one house and film them reacting off of one another. Unfortunately, after his team is rounded up, he finds out that they're not all that talkative, let alone socially awkward. We follow the \"eventful\" lives of an ex-NFL linebacker with narcolepsy named Bert Williams (Ernest Briggs IV), a hand model named Vladimir Illic (Filip Milenkovic), a prodigy trapeze artist now turned kindergarden teacher named Daisy Baxter (Tessa Flores), a hipster photographer named Celeste Graham (Mikaela Euro), and a socially awkward former body-builder fresh out of a monk monastery, Louis Card (Michael Barlow). When you include a deaf cat, nosey neighbors, Hollywood Boulevard, Jason Vorheez, and killer kangaroos to the mix, Terry Goldman finds himself with one helluva show.In the end of this episodic journey, the ensemble cast of distinct characters end up learning how to deal with the hardships of life and eventually find the heart of what really matters most: family. Joining them are constantly working upcoming actors like Austin Rising as Bronco Abernathy (the next-door neighbor), Ross Le as the handsome hipster, Carolyn Feres as Felicity Jones (the sexy librarian), and Michael Torres as Jason."
