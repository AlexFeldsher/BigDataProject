Three separate audiences, representing three different age groups, get to vote, but they cannot see the contestants. When more than half of any age group signals that they like what they hear, the audience pod rotates and the singer is revealed. The catch is - all 3 audiences must approve if the singer is to progress in the competition. True Talent is all that matters, and it is rewarded with a major cash prize.",
