The company specializes in physics consultancy and designing engineering structures. Its domination in the American market has come from the hard work of the longstanding Chairman Roland Bockler. He now introduces fresh young executives under the new director Dan Nguyenski to start a new era in the company. However new challenges suddenly await from competition abroad.
