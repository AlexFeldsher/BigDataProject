After 10 weeks in a hospital he is able to move on to physical therapy with only one goal in mind: to get back on his feet. Unfortunately, his surroundings aren't making it very easy for him, even though his friends and family are strewn all across the world and Felix' only way to communicate with them is virtually, through social networks and webcams.::Wiedemann & Berg Television",

Felix's parents continue to live through ups and downs together, while Vanessa constantly looks for new ways to get revenge on Felix. Add A Friend offers viewers the possibility of delving into lives of people who are connected via live cams. They communicate through the computer and social media, and do everything that used to be done offline: they talk and fight, they fall in love and lie to each other, they lose each other and find each other, they live and work online.::Wiedemann & Berg Television"
