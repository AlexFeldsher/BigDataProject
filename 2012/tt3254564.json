            "\"Medal of Honor: The History Of Heroes\" was birthed by Producers Julia Davis and BJ Davis' \"Medal Of Honor\" (1999-2002) hosted by Academy Award nominee Burt Reynolds in this renewed ongoing television series.On December 21, 1861 President Abraham Lincoln approved and signed Senate Bill 82 into law, creating the Medal Of Honor for heroic acts above and beyond the call of duty, for gallantry in the face of enemy forces engaged in combat.Less than one hundred (100) living Medal of Honor recipients are alive today, while their heroic exploits will forever live on in history.There has been a total of 3,473 Medals of Honor awarded to 3,454 different people. The United States Army has garnered 2,404, the Navy 747, followed by the United States Marines for a 297 total with the Air Force tallying 18 and 1 going to the Coast Guard.There have been 19 two-time recipients, a father and son, the youngest recipient being 12 years old, one U.S. President, General George Armstrong Custers brother Tom Custer, and one woman. From this very unique bracket of heroes, some received a second award, 14 received 2 separate medals for different military engagements and 5 were awarded both the Navy and Army Medals of Honor for the same action.\nDr. Mary Edwards Walker, the first-ever female U.S. Army Surgeon during the Civil War to receive the Medal Of Honor, stripped of the honors and restored by President Jimmy Carter .Americas first whistleblower Buffalo Bill Cody was also ordered to return his Medal of Honor that he received for heroic hand-to-hand combat with Cheyenne War Chief Yellow Hand while serving with the 3rd Calvary Regiment in 1872. Cody fell into disfavor for speaking up against government corruption and abuse of Native Americans during President Ulysses S. Grants administration.The Medal Of Honor has been posthumously awarded to 625 military servicemen.The first Army Medal of Honor was awarded to Union Army Private Jacob Parrott during the American Civil War."
