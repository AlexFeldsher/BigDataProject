So whenever there's danger, Guy transforms into SheZow, a kick-ass female superhero with big hair, high heels and a beautility belt that houses various super weapons concealed inside feminine products like laser lipstick and vanishing cream. Guy's aunt Agnes was secretly SheZow for years, until she died. Then Guy's family inherited her home. In the basement, Guy found her secret lair and her power ring. Well, actually his twin sister Kelly found the ring and was about to put it on, when Guy snatched it from her and and put it on, as a joke. But once on Guy's finger, the ring was stuck and he will forever be SheZow, a powerful superhero with super strength, super speed and a 6th sense called She-S-P. Guy would rather not wear pink spandex and a tight skirt, but it seems a small price to pay for such she-mendous super powers."
