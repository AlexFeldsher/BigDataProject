            "In Great Southern Land, Professor Steve Simpson takes viewers on a unique journey across Australia looking at the daily workings of a modern nation from a truly revealing perspective above.From the skies, Steve uncovers the otherwise hidden patterns, rhythms, networks and systems that keep Australia on the move, fed, alive and thriving. As an entomologist, Steve is used to searching for the big picture in little things, looking at what allows tiny species to survive. But now his sights are set on a bigger creature with fewer legs - us!Taking to the heavens in gliders, helicopters, hot air balloons and anything else that will carry him, Steve can truly appreciate the ingenuity it takes to carve a life in a vast, hostile and ancient continent.Great Southern Land explores how remoteness, tyranny of distance and a tenuous relationship with the natural world are fundamental to shaping the rhythm of daily life in Australia.Soaring across four episodes, this is the tale of living with flood and fire, and our complicated relationship with the natural world. Its the story of satisfying a voracious appetite for lifes vital ingredients: food and electricity.Its also the story of how we inhabit the edge coastal dwellers congregating in sprawling metropolises.And finally, its an epic telling of how we keep it all moving: humans, goods and data."
