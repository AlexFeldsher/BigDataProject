The Battle of Cinco de Mayo marks the beginning of Mexico's prolonged resistance to the invaders, who were ultimately defeated five years later. In the context of an impoverished country, morally weak and immerse in political discord, the triumph of Puebla meant something even more important: the restoration of dignity and the birth of a true national identity. Interviews with recognized experts, conducted in Mexico, the United States and France, together with a remarkable iconography from Mexican and French collections -including unpublished images-, Cinco de Mayo: Mexican Glory, enlightens the importance of the battle, its impact in history, and the significance that its commemoration has acquired for the Mexican-American community.",
