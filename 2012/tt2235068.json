At her wits end, she heads for a heart-shaped island in Okinawa that Tatsuya had once spoken of. On the other hand, at a time earlier than this, Tsuruta Kameko, who has been working as a midwife in Tokyo, gets disgusted with the mentality of frivolous girls who regard abortion as reasonable, and a compromise in natural childbirth because of the hospital, wins a large sum of money in a lottery and leaves for a trip around the world. However, she learns that the Okinawan archipelago that she first stopped at is suffering from a shortage of midwives and decides to set up the ideal maternity hospital down there. These two women of different generations meet in the southern islands.
