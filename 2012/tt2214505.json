            "_Undead Noise_ (qv) follows the life of one aspiring reporter looking for the perfect interview as told through her Internet radio program also called _Undead Noise_ (qv). As she soon finds out, her dream may be harder to achieve than she first anticipated as she experiences many problems along the way including technical difficulties, late guests on a live show, and her quirky co-host. Of course, her problems are not limited to what actually happens on the show, and sometimes it becomes a struggle just for her to show up to her own show on time. Mistress Barbie, her interview moniker on the show, may end up being the person that learns the meaning of pain and suffering before her dreams can be realized.::Amanda Dyar"
