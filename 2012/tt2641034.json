        "plot outline": "A recent investigation by Yale University (2010) stated among other facts that 42% of black women in the United States had never been married compared to their Caucasian counterparts at 23%. This shocking investigation has caught the attention of media powerhouses such as ABC's Nightline, Focus Features Studios, and MSNBC. Although the statistic has been quoted through various outlets, the story of these women and the men that love them had never been addressed; it had yet to be told. It was then that I began to interview these women and the men that had once loved these black women. What were their stories? The various interviews I was able to tell the depictions, so that other black women can relate and see. The stories provided in both the novel and subsequent web-series, \"Black Women Don't Deserve to be Loved\", can help create dialogue between our black women, men and families. If this book can make us take a hard look at ourselves, our friends, our family members, co-workers and allow us to reflect on the issues we have faced in our relationships, than it has completed its mission. It is my hope that by speaking out and letting our sisters know that you are not alone, we can begin to heal and once and for all end the misconception perpetuated that Black Women Don't Deserve to be Loved.",
