We find a busy residential cleaning company managed by its one single employee, Amelia, who is trying to juggle everything in her life; running a business, personal finances, cleaning in some crazy situations, working with clients, making friends and spreading eco-friendly over-the-top cheer. Amelia starts a business when she finally discovers something that she's good at. However, reality sets in and she finds out in a crushing way that she cannot handle it all on her own, thus ensues the hilarious obstacles of hiring staff, but just when she thinks the extra hands will make life easier, they realize that they have their work cut out for themselves. The clients always offer a slew of extra surprises and laughs as our protagonist works to find purpose in her life and in the others around her. Follow this odd team as they deal with larger than life clients and their own personal drama at the juncture of quarter life crises."
