The kid teams must decide on a theme, what to keep, what to scrap, and they only have 3 days to do it! Fortunately, the kids arent alone. Host Michael, along with community volunteers, work with the kids to see that their playground vision is brought to life.Giver does what no other show does it engages children in Ontario to give back and get active with their communities! Season I of the show features the design and building process of thirteen different playgrounds from a build at City Housing Hamilton serving children whose nearest playground was a half hour walk away, a First Nations playground on the reserve of the Chippewas of Georgina Island, and a playground for York Region Childrens Aid Giver realizes that every playground has a unique story reflecting the community that surrounds it. Giver is the show that keeps on giving empowering children across the province to believe that they have the power to change the communities they live in, for the better.\n"
