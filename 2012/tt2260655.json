The goal with this series is to show first-hand the difficulties, challenges and the pressures that young players (especially women) face during the Championship season. We document how training and being part of a club impacts the lives of these young women in their social and personal lives. From the star player planning to emigrate to marriages and babies, for the first time we open the doors to show the lives on and off the pitch of a Ladies Gaelic Football Club. Round Tower GAA Club in Clondalkin is one of the oldest in the country, having been established in 1884 just after the formation of the GAA. What was once a rural village is now a sprawling urban town, but it has managed to retain its sense of community around the club. We join the team at the start of the Championship and follow their journey over the season. The series focuses on the Round Towers team but reflects on wider issues such as a perceived loss of femininity, personal relationships, balancing life and sport and being part of the GAA community.",
