The Senate repudiates him, his family is ruined and his wife, Claudia, fled with his firstborn Cayo to the arms of the man who made him fall into disgrace: Quinto Servilio Cepión.\nWithout his honor and without his newborn son, Galba swears revenge against Quinto and he begins an inexorable rise to power to recover the position that he snatched him. His family, the Sulpicio, must get back the name that they deserve in Rome and Galba is willing to do anything for it.\nHe does not know that an error from his past is haunting him. An error with a womans name... Cora. A young patrician that is determined to unmask Galba, the man who killed her mother and her brother and got to imprison her father, Tiberius, before leaving for Numancia.\nA woman willing to come to an agreement with his greatest enemy to save her father, a man firmly resolved to regain his lost glory and a family that yearns for the control of the whole Rome.\nImperivm ... Because when your friends become your enemies, you only have your family left."
