Bush Institute; Bryan Caplan - professor of economics at George Mason University, research fellow at the Mercatus Center and author; Austan Goolsbee - former chief economist for President Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, a member of the Obama cabinet and professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business; Clarence Page - Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist from the Chicago Tribune.
