            "\"_Bulloch Family Ranch_ (qv)\" chronicles the dramatic everyday adventures of Julie and Rusty Bulloch, a fun-loving working class couple that juggles multiple jobs to make ends meet. Together, they are the proud \"parents\" of currently more than 30 kids. Only two, Amanda and Brodie, are biological. The rest are teens and young adults who have lived at -- and periodically returned to - the Bulloch Ranch during various times of dire need. For almost two decades, the Ranch has served as a place where troubled teens and young adults are welcomed with open arms and given a chance to get back on the right track. Rusty and Julie are committed to giving all their \"kids\" a stable, caring, nurturing environment along with the tools they need to become productive adults. In Season Two, viewers will meet 21-year old single mother Ciara, and discover how a series of bad decisions by those closest to her have left this complicated, beautiful young woman utterly broke, pregnant again and in need of some love and stability. Her relationship with past Ranch kid Shawndell (currently finishing a three-year term in prison for violating parole) is at a turning point. In addition, high school football player Jordan, 17, returns to face multiple challenges -- his senior year, his shoulder injury recovery, and his distracting girlfriend. Twenty-four-year old Wilson continues to work and save up for his wedding by living at the Ranch. This being his second stay with the Bullochs, Wilson now thinks of himself as \"an older, wiser voice\" among the \"kids.\" Finally, talented scholarship footballer and former Ranch \"kid\" Claude Davis, 25, also returns to regroup, train and focus on his return to professional football. To be sure, there's never a dull moment when it comes to the Bullochs. Structure, discipline, love, faith, respect, amazing down home cooking and crazy pranks abound as the UP Original Series \"_Bulloch Family Ranch_ (qv)\" continues.::UP TV"
