The station owner (and father of the incompetent weatherman) has hired Brenda Howard to replace Carol without telling anyone, and she's here for her first day of work. The other anchor is threatened. The field reporter is in love. The makeup artist is confused. The executive producer is fuming. The weatherman just messed up another forecast. And, as quick as an ice cream headache, the rival anchors roll in to laugh in their faces. Can this merry band of misfits get it together by 5am for tomorrow's newscast?",
