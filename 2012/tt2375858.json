There, she is courted by Edmund, a local pastor, and they soon get married under the understanding that Helene is still pure. However, she has a dark past that she must hide from him. When Helene moves into Edmund's home, she falls under the watchful eye of housekeeper Dorothy, who is more than a little involved in her master's life and quite obsessed with his dead first wife, Arabelle, to whom, in her opinion, Helene simply does not compare. While Helene battles to keep her past a secret, she must navigate Dorothy's devious scheming, her husband's harsh critique and a potential new love interest in the form of Dr. Foggerty.",

            "Set in the 1830s, this black comedy centres on Helene, a woman who is washed ashore after her ship is wrecked off the English coast. There, she is courted by Edmund, a local pastor, and they soon get married under the understanding that Helene is still pure. However, she has a dark past that she must hide from him. When Helene moves into Edmund's home, she falls under the watchful eye of housekeeper Dorothy, who is more than a little involved in her master's life and quite obsessed with his dead first wife, Arabelle, to whom, in her opinion, Helene simply does not compare. While Helene battles to keep her past a secret, she must navigate Dorothy's devious scheming, her husband's harsh critique and a potential new love interest in the form of Dr. Foggerty.::wikipedia"
