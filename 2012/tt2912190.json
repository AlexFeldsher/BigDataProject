Despite growing up poor, she remained kind, caring and helpful towards other people and these traits make Justin fall in love with her even more. On the other hand, Justin is the son of a rich owner of a furniture factory where Andrea works. Justin's parents are opposed to their relationship but because of Justin's love for Andrea, he fights for her and their relationship. However, a tragedy strikes and destroys their dreams of having a simple and happy family life together. On her way to the wedding, Andrea will figure in a car accident and will end up in a coma at a hospital where it was found out that she is pregnant. But fate will turn out for the worse when fire breaks out in the hospital. During the ruckus, Andrea wakes up from coma and escapes from the fire. Everyone thought Andrea died in the fire but she will find refuge in a house where Celso, a rich and kind-hearted doctor lives. Because she was in deep coma for a long time, Andrea was scared and confused when Celso found her; she was at a loss as to her identity. Celso promised that he will help her and will let her stay at his place; thereby giving her a new name, Lorraine. Celso took care of Andrea as Lorraine; and they started to fall in love with each other. Justin on the other hand, was slowly trying to move on with his life, with the help of another woman, Dr. Sabrina Torres. Andrea and Justin cross paths during the time the former is already preparing for his own wedding with Sabrina.
