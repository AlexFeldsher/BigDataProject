            "Created and executive produced by James Franco and Vince Jolivette, \"Undergrads: South\" captures a behind-the-scenes look at college life and the unique experiences of undergraduates as they struggle to balance their personal lives, school obligations and movie-making dreams. (Shot in Austin, Texas.)The show follows young go-getting producer David Bukstein; the heartfelt, yet playful documentarian/editor, Morgan Young, Bao Truong, the introspective auteur and Ali Haji, the \"singing\" producer. 90% percent of the project was shot, edited by and stars people who are in college and was shaped by director Joy Gohring.The \"Undergrads: South\" pilot screened at the 2012 SXSW Film Conference where Gohring and the cast were invited to participate in a making of panel. Series highlights include: Young making a PSA for the Brady Campaign and interviewing gun violence survivors. Truong following local band Little Lo to Los Angeles, only to discover Hollywood isnt all that inviting; Haji and his choral group in a real life version of \"Glee;\" and last but not least, Bukstein discovering his dad is a cross dresser.\n"
