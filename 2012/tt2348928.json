Navigating around the thunderhead is not an option, as it would take them into Iraqi airspace. Meanwhile, their boss Cory Bengtzen and Randy McGehee are caught in their own battle for survival, flying through North Eastern Russia. Witness the effects of hypothermia firsthand as the two desperately fight to keep their body heat, judgment, and reaction times up amid rapidly dropping temperatures.    "
