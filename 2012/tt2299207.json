Twigs can't wait to show Tom the courtyard where there are presents, coloured lights (fireflies), crackers (cracker pods) and a Christmas Tree-shaped fungus. In their excitement, Tom and Twigs rush in and pop crackers. Twigs gives his present to Tom - it's a super Trickshot Squizzle - he rushes into using it before reading the instructions. The Squizzle hits the tree which falls and scares away the fireflies and smashes the all-important Star-Crystal decoration; they've destroyed Winterfest! Tom and Twigs ...    "
