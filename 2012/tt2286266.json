            "San Francisco puts a West-Coast spin on Science's mega-hit series ODDITIES. The show follows crazy transactions as big, odd memorable characters come in out of the famed store Loved To Death, located in the heart of San Francisco. The shop's cases and walls are overflowing with rare scientific curiosities; there's something for everyone on the sales floor. This oddball staff led by shop owner, Audra, is always leaving the shop to hunt for more strange and obscure pieces to add to the inventory. Unique items and customers cycle through their doors each day, in addition to the wild experiences that happen outside the shop's walls: This cast of characters have come to expect the unexpected."
