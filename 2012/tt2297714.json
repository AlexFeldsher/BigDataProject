            "In a total of 64 days, crew of 5 men venture on four SeaDoo personal watercraft from Seattle, Washington to Haines, Alaska where the Dangerous Waters RV pulls out the Sea-Doos and hauls them to Anchorage, Alaska were they are launched back into the water for the next leg of the adventure. The team then travels down Cook Inlet to Kodiak, Alaska by water and then onto the Aleutian islands and up the Coast of Western Alaska, camping along the way in the wild territory. The ultimate goal of the trip is to reach Nome, Alaska by Sea-doo with no chase boat or other craft, a world first on many levels. The men encounter wildlife such as whales, wolverines, and brown bears, helpful locals in every town, and secluded beaches for safe-haven against wicked waters and weather. Narrated by Peter Coyote and Gary Gelfand."
