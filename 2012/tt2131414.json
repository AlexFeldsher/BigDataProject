To stay afloat, South Point needs 15,000 gamblers to walk through their doors every day! And their way of doing so is by hosting over-the-top spectacular events such as a jousting competition for 3,000 medieval fanatics or a rodeo for hundreds of rowdy cowboys watching their favorite professional bull riders hang on a bull for dear life. Running these events is a high-stakes operation whose success depends on a lot of people sweating the small stuff. The \"Vegas Stripped\" audience will be immersed in the daily challenge of making South Point a profitable, fun, glitzy glamorous destination, watching as each and every obstacle unfolds.",
