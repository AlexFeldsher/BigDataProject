She has a \"Yuta\" power awakened within her due to an incident when she was young. A mysterious entity called \"Secret\" suddenly appears and launches an attack on the Scub Coral lifeform on the island. Ao launches a certain military FP called \"Nirvash\" aboard a Japanese military transport in his fervent desire to protect the island."
