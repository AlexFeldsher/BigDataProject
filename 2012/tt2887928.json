        "plot outline": "Sisters Erica and Bianca have always lived a happy and comfortable life with their parents that painted for them an ideal image of \"true love\". Keeping this so-called image in mind, Erica meets Jake and falls in love with him. But her idea of a perfect love story was ruined after Jake mysteriously disappeared and was never heard from again. As Erica tries to move on, life takes a dark turn when they meet an accident that left both Erica and Bianca's parents dead. Tension begins to grow between the two sisters when Bianca finds out that she might be in danger of losing her sight as a result of the accident. With no one else to turn to, Erica approaches her boss Jaime, a divorced businessman who has always paid special attention to her. Soon after, Jaime professes his feelings for Erica, and eventually asks for her hand in marriage. Erica, being reminded of the many good things Jaime has done for her and her sister, agrees. As the day of their wedding approaches, Erica's life turns upside down when Jaime's children from his first wife Beatrice return - Jaime's scheming daughter Leslie and son, Joaquin, who turns out to be Erica's former boyfriend Jake",
