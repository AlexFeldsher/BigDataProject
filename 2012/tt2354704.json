        "plot outline": "Tanaka Chiharu is a contract employee for a travel agent. She's 34 years old and hasn't had a boyfriend in over five years. All of her friends of similar age are getting married, so she's starting to feel anxious that she might not be able to get married. Kirishima Haruko is a successful landscape gardening planner. She's 44 years old and was having an affair with her boss for a quite some time. Therefore, she is looking at romance from a farsighted perspective and resigned herself from getting married. Chiharu and Haruko happen to meet each other for the first time at the wedding of Chiharu's sister, where they hit it off right away and decided to move together at Haruko's place. They are very different in terms of personality and age, which leads to a very delightful interaction between the two. Of course they frequently fight with each other, but they also support each other as much as they can. Kudo Junpei is a part-time worker at a flower shop. He's 32 years old and a very kindhearted and sensitive man who is not very proactive when it comes to love. Kudo doesn't have the confidence to get married and to support another person let alone a whole family.",
