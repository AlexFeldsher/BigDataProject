        "plot outline": "The program of \"Yo Soy Un Gamer\" involves a ludicrous plot spanning 8 different arcs, each with their own different Hambo. These distinct parts are characterized by the greatness of the exposure of its main character, Hambo, and the different interactions with their personal, called \"Gamers\". These personas vary in ability, with Hambo's own Gamer called Trans Fat, a Gamer with the ability to stop blood clots while eating kilograms of unhealthy foods. The main villain of these arcs is the eternal vampire, WAPA, and his Gamer, Salary Sold Substantially Low (S3L), with the ability to build a communist economy in the blink of an eye. All Hambo are bound to their bloodline in order to defeat WAPA and his underlings. Hambo is joined by his comrades: Molusko (Gamer: Quenepas Atragantadas) and La Burbu (Gamer: Burbumoji), each with their own unique Gamer abilities (choking and selling at extraordinary prices, respectively). Will Hambo and his comrades succeed in defeating the evil WAPA, or will WAPA usher in a new age of communist rule in Puerto Rican media? Find out by watching after the late night news at 11:30pm in Channel 4!",
