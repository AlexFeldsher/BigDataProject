This 'expert\" merely needed to look at the homes roofline which was shown clearly in the opening shots to see the house almost certainly had cathedral ceilings. The amount of value \"assigned\" to the home leapt enormously when surprise! It turned out to have cathedral ceilings. In the same vein as storage wars et al this is show is an amusing but hardly challenging way to pass time."
