            "Once upon a time, a team of basketball prodigies rose to the top by demolishing all competition. This team became known as the Generation of Miracles, as they are all in the same year group and they were considered children of miracle. After junior high school ended, these five stars went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, a fact few people know is that there was another player accompanying the Generation of Miracles, a Phantom Sixth Man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, yet little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko, the sixth man formerly with the Generation of Miracles, and Taiga Kagami, a naturally talented player who spent most of junior high school in America, are aiming to bring Seirin to the top of Japan, taking on Kuroko's old teammates one by one."
