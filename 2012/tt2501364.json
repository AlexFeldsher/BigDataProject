Each week host Lori Halbert serves up a little \"Political Food for Thought\" as she interviews politicians from all across Florida, while teaching them how to prepare a delicious meal. So, who are the people writing the laws for our state, and our county? How do they feel about their service, their duty to us, the toll it takes on their families, their jobs and their lives? It was with these questions in mind, I set myself to find a way to present an elected official in a manner in which everyone can relate, and to combine my love of cooking with what I learned in the kitchens across my district to present my audience with the real people who serve them in public office. Food is truly the \"great uniter\". Everyone must eat, and someone must prepare it, so what better way to get to know someone than in the kitchen? I find this to be the perfect setting since the kitchen is the heart of the home, where families gather, take nourishment, and make their own decisions for their future. This is not a show to promote my beliefs or my agenda. It is a non-partisan show that will allow a hungry public to draw their own conclusions about the real people who serve as their elected officials. Viewers will have a chance to learn a new recipe, and perhaps come away with a new taste for how their government works and realizing the person working for them in office is just like you and me, with hopes and dreams not that different from our own.",
