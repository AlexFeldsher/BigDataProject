In a time no one remembers anymore, cavemen wandered the Earth without Google maps, and humanity floundered for centuries. Part 2: Computers: The Thing You Need To Make the Internet - The U.S. military invented the Internet to kill foreigners. Instead they gave the world porn. Get the whole, untold story. Part 3: The Roaring 90s: Tech Stocks Gone Wild: The tech boom of the roaring 90s - Our best national delusion yet. Learn about it on The Onion's History of the Internet. Part 4: Y2k: A Civilization Rises From The Ashes - In the charred wasteland left in the crash's wake, roving bands of cannibals ruled the land. Many saved themselves from disaster by building fortresses out of surplus direct-mail AOL disks. Part 5: Social Networks: Better Than Real Friends - Social networks made having real friends obsolete and, frankly, a little pathetic. Why go to a dinner party with four or five friends when you could instead post a photo of you eating dinner alone and have eighty strangers \"like\" it? Part 6: Interactivity: Joining the Conversation About Hitler - With the rise of more online interactivity, we enter an era when socially awkward Americans finally got serious about wasting their lives. Part 7: Smart Phones: The Technology Bricks That Changed Our Lives - The Onion reveals the history of smart phones, the tiny external brains that do our thinking for us now. Part 8: The Internet's Future: The Inhuman Road Ahead - How is the Internet going to evolve in the future? Scientists predict that strap-on web-goggles will allow us to surf the web while stepping blindly into traffic.",
