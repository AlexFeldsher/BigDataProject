It is where athletes have an opportunity to share REAL experiences from their playing days, that no one has heard publicly before. Whether funny or heartfelt, on or off the court, these are entertaining short stories from the past for all ardent NBA fans. To compliment these engaging stories, each independent player's interview is highly stylized. The show is not your traditional studio talking head interview. We challenge our creativity each episode with mulitple locations and multiple camera angles, to enhance the overall feel of the show. Each half hour episode consists of three new exclusive player interviews. Also integrated into the series are street interview segments with hard-core basketball fans, celebrities, distinguished executives and other professional athletes.",
