        "plot outline": "'Each and every day we have the chance to make a difference in the life of another person. I believe it; my husband believes it; my children believe it.' Jodi Orton and her husband Bret have done just that. In this beautifully filmed short, Jodi candidly shares her story with the world. She talks about her personal transformational change, and her turbulent transition from high powered senior paralegal to devoted foster and adoptive parent. In this thought provoking film, Jodi speaks to us all in the wider world about our love of materialism and the importance placed on personal gain. She describes her own journey into wealth and personal gain, through a difficult period of conflict, to find at the end of it the things that really matter. Through Jodi's story we can all reflect on how finding ones own purpose in life can lead to a deeper sense of happiness. Jodi opens up her home and her family of ten foster and adopted children, all of whom have special needs commonly associated with children in care. Shot on location in Warsaw, Missouri, against the backdrop of the beautiful lakes region and autumnal colour of the Fall.",
