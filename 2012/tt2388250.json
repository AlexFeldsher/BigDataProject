These toys need to be tested, and those tests are carried out by the lowest rung of the company, the Prototype Department. Working in an office that looks more like a decked-out, nerdy frat house, Crad, Addison, and October test toy and game prototypes for quality, danger and defect. But most of their time is actually spent dealing with bizarre office politics, oddball guests, and their own imaginations. Sitcom adventures ensue, punctuated by off-the-wall live action and animated sketches. Team-leader Crad has some anger management issues, but he's fiercely loyal to his two buddies, and he tries hard to be a good father to his sarcastic, wiser-than-her-years daughter, Susie. Addison is the not-so-bright, but positive and fun-loving guy with a zest for life and an aversion to his ADD medication. And then there's October, a deadpan, well-educated, Edward-Scissorhands-meets-Spock, steam punk enthusiast, living in his own dark little universe. The trio are in nerd heaven, drinking and doing drugs on the job while playing with toys all day but they're easily distracted and impossible to keep on task, not to mention they are constantly thwarted by zany obstacles. Jesse, a corporate-climbing middle management game designer, thinks he's in charge of the Prototypes Department, and is always trying to steal any profitable toy and game ideas. Alexandra, the lustful man-eating boss, is more than willing to abuse her power with her underlings and routinely threatens everyone's jobs. Alexandra's father and the doddering founder, Mr. Gottfried, wanders the company's halls, often making crazy demands for toy designs which the guys must bend over backwards to accommodate. And then there are the Video Game Testers (aka \"VGT's\"), the other nerdy trio and arch-rivals of the Prototypes, prank the three men and set them up for failure. Numerous guest toy designers, spokespeople, long-lost relatives and other odd folks round out the cast of characters who succeed at making life extra complicated for our heroes. The show's variety of live action and animated comedy sketches spring from the guys' daydreams, their off-color discussions, the toys and games that they test and collect, and moments in the characters' somewhat warped minds.",

            "Gottfried Bros Toy & Train Co. makes everything from video games to board games, from toy cars to action figures. These toys need to be tested, and those tests are carried out by the lowest rung of the company, the Prototype Department. Working in an office that looks more like a decked-out, nerdy frat house, Crad, Addison, and October test toy and game prototypes for quality, danger and defect. But most of their time is actually spent dealing with bizarre office politics, oddball guests, and their own imaginations. Sitcom adventures ensue, punctuated by off-the-wall live action and animated sketches.
