Instead he brings back a reluctant plastic surgeon and spoiled brat, Dr. Yoo Eun-Soo (Hee-Seon Kim). She saves the princess' life and becomes known as Eui Seon, the great doctor from heaven. Unfortunately, while this position is privileged, it is also dangerous as no fewer than three politicians, the king and his uncle (Yoon-Jae Park) and a nobleman (Oh-Seong Yu), fight over her custody. But she grows increasingly attached to Choi who dedicates himself to protecting her by playing the politicians against each other; although, he tries to favor the king as long as the latter's interests do not conflict with Yoo's.
