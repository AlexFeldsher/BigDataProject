Meanwhile, Inigo will grow up hating the Paroas because her mother Rosanna told him that his father died because of them. He will be Mariposa's high school classmate. He has a bad-boy image and always gets kicked out from school that's why he is still in his sophomore year. Inigo and Mariposa will be friends but because of peer pressure he will also mock and make fun of Mariposa. However, when Mariposa transforms into a beautiful Paroa, Inigo will like and develop feelings towards her not knowing that she is the same girl who he mocked and at the same time a Paroa who he grew up hating",
