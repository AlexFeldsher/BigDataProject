            "\"Dog With a Blog\" is a sitcom that is told from the pup's perspective. The show is about a newly blended family led by parents Bennett and Ellen, whose kids -- Tyler, Avery and Chloe -- are trying to adjust to life as step-siblings. Tyler and Avery are typical teenagers and are slowly learning to communicate with each other. When they discover a secret about the family's recently adopted pet dog, Stan, they decide to keep it a secret -- even from their parents. What is Stan's secret? He talks and blogs. Complicating their attempt to keep the secret is younger sister Chloe, who thinks it's normal to have a talking pooch after she overhears him. But thankfully the parents just chalk it up to Chloe's overactive imagination. As for Stan, he has a knack for getting himself, Tyler and Avery into sticky situations, which helps teach the kids how important family is and how much they need to work together to keep Stan's secret safe.::Unknown"
