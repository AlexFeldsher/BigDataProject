As a society, we are engulfed with so much anger, why are we so angry, does this level of anger benefit us as a society, what do we need to do to purge ourselves from this toxic emotion? This documentary series will be issue-driven and will look beyond the fairytale transformation and analyse the current national psyche of South Africans. It explores diverse voices ranging from expert advice, social commentators to popular opinion with the aim of getting to the bottom of our anger, in order to allow us to move forward as a nation in building our country and a united national identity.",
