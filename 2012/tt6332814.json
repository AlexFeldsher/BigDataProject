        "plot outline": "The story revolves around three forty-year-old women: supermarket cashier Ye Hong, lawyer Du Xiaoling, and returned overseas Chinese Song Qing . After Ye Hong divorced her ex-husband who is a gambler, she rents one room with her son in a house owned by He Jing, a taxi driver who is also divorced. One day, ironically, He Jing's ex-wife and Ye Hong's ex-husband move into the house at the same time, and it is rather awkward for the four people to live together. As Ye Hong offers to take care of He Jing's ex-wife who becomes paralyzed in a car accident, He Jing is deeply touched. They two then fall in love with each other. Hu Zhendong and Du Xiaoling meet each other because of a divorce case. When dealing with this divorce case, they two gradually develop feelings towards each other. And then they become a couple. Song Qing and Li Xiaolong open an Art Cafe together. As they are like-minded friends, Li Xiaolong is strongly attracted to Song Qing. When Song Qing's ex-husband returns to China, Song Qing realizes that her ex-husband's change of heart is what she really wants. Bloom at Forty is about the hot social issue of single middle-aged people, reflecting urban people's views on marriage and relationship. It is a Chinese version Desperate Housewives, depicting how three middle-aged women build their happy lives. It encourages women to strive for happiness, step forward bravely, and be strong. All in all, this drama reveals the inner world of contemporary middle-aged women.",
