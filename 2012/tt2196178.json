During their time at MAEWIN, recruits fight in an arena from 9-5 - while the rest of their time is their own (provided they stay in the MAEWIN-run Safe Houses). The series follows a particular set of Job Hunters as they deal with adjusting to life in the Safe Houses, dealing with roommate issues, as well as sorting through feelings of their own impending doom.",

            "_Job Hunters_ (qv) is set in the near future, where college graduates must fight (potentially to the death) to be placed by the MAEWIN corporation into careers. With a pass-rate of about 20%, this process is also a form of population control. During their time at MAEWIN, recruits fight in an arena from 9-5 - while the rest of their time is their own (provided they stay in the MAEWIN-run Safe Houses). The series follows a particular set of _Job Hunters_ (qv) as they deal with adjusting to life in the Safe Houses, dealing with roommate issues, as well as sorting through feelings of their own impending doom.::Tara Theoharis"
