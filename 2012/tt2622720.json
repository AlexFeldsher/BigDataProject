            "The serialized drama, \"Sin Verguenza\" (Without Shame), follows one fictional family, the Salazars, who live in East Los Angeles. The story lines are based on experiences by patients at the clinic, AltaMed, and cover such topics as infidelity, stigma and family secrets. The four-episode show - in both English and Spanish - is part of a public health campaign to promote HIV prevention, encourage patients to get tested and urge patients with HIV to seek medical care.::Will Kohler"
