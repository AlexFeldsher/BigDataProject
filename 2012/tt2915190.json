        "plot outline": "During the nationwide auditions, the selection process is based on 3 main criteria : vocal performance, stage presence and musical diversity. During each episode, each family performs a song which will make the most out of their singing abilities; no individual performance. The families will be paired with a singing celeb who will act as their coach: during the rehearsal sessions, the coaches' role is to give their best tips and advice so the families can surpass themselves when performing for the first time on national TV and in front of a live audience. It's important to point out that the coaches are precisely that: coaches, not judges. The judges are the viewers as they're the ones to decide 1) which of the 3 performing families per episode will come back to the next episode to perform with the coaches (9 out of 27 families will be selected over the first 9 episodes), 2) those out of the winning families of the regular season, who will make it to the semi-finals (3 out of 9 families will be selected over the 3 semi-finals) and 3) those out of the 3 semi-finalists who will make it to the grand finale, our 1*90min live episode. Over the regular season, at the end of each episode, it's time to vote: the viewers have until the following day at noon to select their favorite family i.e., the one that will come back for a performance with the coaches at the end of the following week's show; this selection process will go on for the first 9 episodes; then, we start the semi-finals with episodes 10, 11 & 12: The Semi-Finals Out of the 9 selected families, 3 will perform on episode 10, then 11 and episode 12. The voting system is the same; however, the identity of the 3 winning families as a result of those 3 semi-finals, will only be disclosed at the grand finale and not at the end of each semi-final. The Grand Finale A spectacular 90min episode, live, where the 3 semi-finalists will give their best shot in the hope of becoming the most favorite singing family in the country! Family Harmony is more than a talent show: it is first and foremost a feel-good show about the joy of singing together, as a family!",
