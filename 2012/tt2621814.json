            "Do you have a stereotype of West Virginia? Do you think we are just a bunch of redneck, hillbillies who carry guns and yell \"Yeeeehaaaw!\" You are sadly mistaken. There is much more to this \"Almost Heaven\" Mountain State. Home to brilliant minds like John Nash (his true story portrayed in \"A Beautiful Mind\" starring Russell Crowe), music legend Bill Withers (Lean On Me), long-time comedic actor Don Knotts (Barney Fife himself), sports icon Jerry West (The NBA logo) and The Discovery Channel Founder and businessman extraordinaire John Hendricks. We have mountains and valleys and more then you realize. So \"Take a sip of what we're brew'n!\" at The Coffee Talk Show (a production of The Cuppa Joe Foundation). Interviews, music and lots of fun with celebrity guests and up and comers who have ties to the great state of West Virginia. We think you'll find, what all of us Mountaineers already know, we are filled with talented, amazing and iconic people."
