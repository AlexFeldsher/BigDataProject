            "_Fast N' Loud_ (qv) follows motor mastermind Richard Rawlings and mechanical whiz kid Aaron Kaufmann as they search the far flung corners of Texas and beyond for beat-up, classic cars they can buy and restore at their home base, Gas Monkey Garage, in Dallas. While 'in Rome,' they'll fall in with the local customs and characters - an all American road trip with full throttle attitude. Ultimately, Richard and Aaron will do whatever it takes to finish their cars and make auction. But will their blood, sweat and beers translate into cold hard cash?::Coolfire Originals"
