            "\"Shut Up and Sign\" is a crazy Sign Language dvd series starring Bob Hiltermann that's designed to make learning American Sign Language FUN, using skits stories and music videos. The series includes several \"Episodes,\" all designed to teach American Sign Language (ASL) in fun ways. Each episode includes a hysterical signed music video that uses words that were taught in the lesson. The series also includes \"Reading Fingerspelling Practice\" dvd's that are each almost an hour in length of nothing but fingerspelled words and funny sentences for the ASL student to practice his/her Fingerspelling reading skills. Those dvds are available in \"Beginner,\" \"Intermediate\" and \"Advanced\" speeds.\nBob Hiltermann is not only a well-known and acclaimed Educator in Los Angeles, but is also an actor (\"Children of a Lesser God,\" \"All My Children,\" \"See What I'm Saying,\"). He is also in the world's only all-deaf band \"Beethoven's Nightmare\" which performs to huge audiences around the world.\nMarty Elcan, the Director, has worked in the film industry for over 25 years (\"Driving Miss Daisy,\" \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"My Favorite Martian,\" \"Six Feet Under,\" \"Next of Kin\"). She discovered Bob when she took a refresher Sign Language class, and knew she had to share this zany entertaining teacher with the rest of America."
