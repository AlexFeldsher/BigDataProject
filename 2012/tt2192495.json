Their girlfriend from the past comes into the picture and now the 3 of them are bent on partying like Rock-stars and reliving their past one more time before it's too late. These girls do what the boys do, they take advantage of guys, use them to get what they want but it's always in the name of fun. They smoke cigars, play pool, poker and beer pong and they do it well. With random neighbors popping in and the sexy twins taunting Ted and Rex (the 2 supporting males), there is never a dull moment, oh and don't forget the Chinese man that just shows up at the most inopportune times! It's a cross between Friends and Seinfeld with the main setting being a large condo in an upscale condo community that has a shared common area and swimming pool, things will be heating up at the pool this summer.",
