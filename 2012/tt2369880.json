La famille d'HomoSapiens DotCom vit dans une vallée qui \"résiste encore et toujours à l'évolution Darwiniste\" en -40 000 avant JC. La mère est professeur de Préhistoire-Géo tandis que le père est professeur de chasse dans le même collège. L'adolescente a 14 ans (déjà presque adulte) et fréquente le fils du directeur d'EDF, le fils est un alter-Darwiniste qui milite régulièrement avec son ami primate. Un festival de gags anachroniques qui mettent en lumière notre XXIème siècle. ___________________________\nUne série courte de Jul d'après sa BD - Réalisée par Jérémie Hoarau\n"
