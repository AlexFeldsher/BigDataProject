        "plot outline": "What happens after the world ends? Written and directed by award winning playwright Kit Williamson, \"EastSiders\" explores the aftermath of infidelity on a gay couple in Silverlake. When Cal (Kit Williamson) finds out Thom (Van Hansis) has been cheating on him with Jeremy (Matthew McKelligon), their relationship is turned upside down. Will the lies tear them apart or are they just stubborn enough to stay together forever? Drunken outbursts and double standards abound in this dark comedy about the sad and funny messes we make out of our lives. Cal's best friend Kathy (Constance Wu) is always there for him with a bottle of whiskey in her purse, but she has her own problems with her nice guy boyfriend Ian (John Halbach), even if they're all in her head. Stephen Guarino guest stars as a party promoter throwing one last bash before the apocalypse.",

            "What happens after the world ends? Written and directed by award winning playwright Kit Williamson, \"EastSiders\" explores the aftermath of infidelity on a gay couple in Silverlake. When Cal (Kit Williamson) finds out Thom (Van Hansis) has been cheating on him with Jeremy (Matthew McKelligon), their relationship is turned upside down. Will the lies tear them apart or are they just stubborn enough to stay together forever? Drunken outbursts and double standards abound in this dark comedy about the sad and funny messes we make out of our lives. Cal's best friend Kathy (Constance Wu) is always there for him with a bottle of whiskey in her purse, but she has her own problems with her nice guy boyfriend Ian (John Halbach), even if they're all in her head. Stephen Guarino guest stars as a party promoter throwing one last bash before the apocalypse.::Kit Williamson"
