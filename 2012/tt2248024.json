            "At the corner of the Athenian streets Asklipiou and Didotou, halfway between the elegant Kolonaki and grungy Exarchia districts, stands an aquarium-like beauty parlor for passers-by to peek into. The Bellino boasts a female clientele of all age groups. Ladies who live around the corner mingle with high heeled business women from morning till night time, as they come and go for manicures and foot massages. Tomazina, the boss, together with Valia and Sotiria, the estheticians, spice up every discussion. The parlor whose location offers the best views on the neighborhood becomes a theatre of female debate. The starry nail polish ends up being just the cherry on top."
