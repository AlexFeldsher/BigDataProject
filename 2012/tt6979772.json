            "_The Bomber_ (qv) is a love story taking place within the larger confines of World War II on the eastern front. The bomber airplane in the series title merely serves as the vehicle to take three Soviet aircrew into German occupied Russian territory where it is shot down and the rest of the story unfolds. Once on the ground, the three interact with German troops, Russian guerillas, and Russian citizens as they try to stay alive and participate in the Russian war effort to thwart the German invasion of their mother Russia. Two of the aircrew are married and their attempts to find each other in the chaos of war is part of the story.::orcadan"
