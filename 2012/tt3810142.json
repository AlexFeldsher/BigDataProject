It portrays that if the paths of the two lovers goes astray, life has a way of bringing them back together. It doesn't really matter that how rare the chances are, or how vast the distances are, where there is love there is a way. The grandparents Hamid & Amna have arrived from Islamabad to visit their son Taha, his wife Aisha and their nine year old daughter Hira. Amna notices the consistent absence of Aisha from the house and it is obvious to her that her granddaughter is being neglected. Taha has been married upon his strict, yet loving mother's wishes to her niece, Aisha who is struggling to balance her career as a model and is over wrought by her work commitments. Taha is a compassionate and compromising husband who understands his wife's commitment to her career and he tries his best to fulfill a balance between his job and the house and ends up playing the role of both the mother and father to their daughter. Taha's charm also extends at his workplace as his co-worker Zara is enthralled by his ability to manage his work and married life; however he makes it very clear to her that she is just a colleague to him. However, for Taha things are not going well in their marriage as Hira begins to feel insecure about her mother's love and neglect causing some full on confrontations between Taha and Aisha as they struggle to maintain a balance in their married life.",
