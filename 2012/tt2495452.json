This sets off a chain of events that keeps taking the two friends closer and closer to the truth, one that is almost incomprehensible. With their memories wiped and counting on information given them by people who show back up into their lives, it is a game of Chess and the ultimate game of wits and survival. Upon getting their memories back they realize that what they were apart of and what they have done, will change the World if they proceed, and they also know that this change would be catastrophic to humanity. So join the two friends as they uncover what they did in a Black Ops Operation called 'Raven' and whom it was that they really worked for and why they, of all people, were chosen for this. It is a high stakes game of cat and mouse, with an ending that few, would ever suspect."
