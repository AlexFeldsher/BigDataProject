Venturing through the seas off Song Doc in search of sea snakes, in the markets and the back alleys of Le Mat Village in Hanoi for kraits and cobras, and in the jungles for the elusive and endangered king cobra, Kenny and Zoltan put themselves at risk hunting these snakes in the name of science and adventure. To add to the challenge, they must do all this while being followed by famed photographer Mattias Klum and the National Geographic Magazine crew who must meet their assignment goals and deadlines while avoiding any mortal bites. Can they accomplish their goals and get in some cave diving for Kenny, or will that end up being the most dangerous challenge of all? From finding Venom Viagra and an elusive king cobra in the jungle, to Mattias' close encounter with a cobra's bite, to sharing a life-threatening experience in an underwater cave, Kenny and Zoltan show how science can be an adventure.",
