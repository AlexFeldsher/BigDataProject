            "A modern day re-telling of the Beauty and Beast fairy tale, this re imagination of the original uses military medical experimentation to create the \"Beast\" (Vincent Keller) with the down side of there being no \"Magic Cure\" to resolve what's been done to him.The Beauty (Catherine Chandler) is tied to the beast via her mother, the scientist involved in the experiments done to these soldiers.Vincent Keller, the beast, is in hiding for the past 10 years from the corporation tied to the government responsible for the experiments, and fears that he, like most of his brethren, will be killed if they find him.Catherine Chandler is a sharp, confident woman studying to become a lawyer when we first meet her only to later become a homicide detective after her mother was murdered in front of her. This is her first encounter with the Beast as he saves her from her mother's assassins.The show has been reworked and is no longer \"procedural\" based, it now focuses on the relationship of its leading couple with the trials & tribulations they now face as the corporation continues to hunt Vincent."
