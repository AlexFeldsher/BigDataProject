            "Tired of the modern capitalist vortex, a group of people from different countries undertake a journey with no return to become real citizens of the world. Traveling the road by feet or by horse, the travelers return to the early roots of the human being by living separated from consumerism, coexisting with nature and reconnecting their spirituality through practices such as meditation and nature studies. \"Nomads\", a documentary series that captures a journey of more than 14 years, where adventure leads to self discovery, and the old errant ways of life collect adepts on its path.::Btf"
