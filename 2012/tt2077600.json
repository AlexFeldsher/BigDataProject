            "The TV show is about an innovative program focusing on the mental game of sports, business and life and focuses on how people learn, perform and achieve greatness in their professions and life. Bill Cole, MS, MA, Mental Game Coach and the shows host and co-creator says, Paradoxically, the mind is the last frontier of study and control in anything we do. Top achievers and performers know that mind power is what separates them from the rest of the field and catapults them into the winners circle. A strong mental game is the potent magic behind overcoming the inevitable mental and emotional obstacles that everyone faces in their quest for success in learning, performing and achieving. Prior to the show, each guest completes a comprehensive analysis called the Mental Game Assessment (MGSA) study. The MSGA reveals both how they win and how they fail. The show chooses people of all ages who have a compelling story to tell, and who want to create a breakthrough in their life. Designed as a learning process, both the audience and the guest explore and experience how they overcome these mental game obstacles and breakthrough to a new level of achievement. The show is currently being packaged to present to select TV networks in mid 2012."
