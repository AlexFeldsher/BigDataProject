            "David Hobbs has been America's favorite Dad for the past 10 years, but that is all coming to an end. As David says goodbye to his life of sitcom T.V., reality awaits him at home with his wife and three kids. When the stay-at-home parent roles switch, David must learn the ins and outs of being a house-dad, while his wife Amy returns to the big screen. Suddenly, looking after three quirky kids and keeping their home in check becomes his newest starring role!More about the characters:David HobbsDavid has spent the last 10 years playing the perfect dad on T.V. and seems to have forgotten how to master his real-life role of \"world's best dad\". Now that his wife has gone back to work, it's David's turn to takeover at home and life with his three kids proves to be one crazy adventure! He has a lot to learn, but his love for his family, quick thinking, and good sense of humor becomes the perfect recipe for this new journey.Amy HobbsThis is one super-mom you don't want to mess with! Amy will do anything for her children, but her decision to return back to the big screen means a little less time at home. While the idea of leaving her babies to the care of David puts her stomach in jitters, her support and love for him conquers all. Between picking up her old career and maintaining a full house, its easy to say her life certainly isn't is dull.Emily HobbsEmily Hobbs is sister to Joe and Janie, and the eldest of the three Hobbs kids. While she deals with the everyday drama that comes with being a teenager, her biggest dilemma revolves around a patchy relationship with her dear ol' dad, David.Joe HobbsJoe is the middle child of the Hobbs clan, which might explain some of his wacky actions. Though he can take himself a little too seriously at times (he hates being late!), it doesn't stop him from all the fun that comes with being a kid.Janie HobbsJanie is sweet as pie and a real crowd pleaser. Small as she is, her age never gets in the way of her having her own voice... even if it means getting wrapped into some sticky situations from time to time!"
