            "A telenovela styled series centered around the Fuentes family whose patriarch, Paco, suffers renal failure. Further complications arise as family members, including his wife, Carmencita, and adult children, Margie and Paco, Jr. consider donating but each are busy individuals with work and university commitments. Another relative also suffering from renal complications \"loses\" a previous transplant due to noncompliance, and provides a foil to the Fuentes family's determination to remain positive. While being a family drama with comedic touches demonstrating the ups and downs of critical care patients, it is also designed to provide vital renal information especially to the Latino American community. Emphasis is placed on family support during difficult times, knowledge of transplantation options and proactive healthcare. \"Fixing Paco\" is a heartwarming family program that can be enjoyed and provide education to people from all backgrounds."
