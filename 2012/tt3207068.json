            "The Takeover is the business makeover format that sees the boss of a company surprise their employees and leave them entirely on their own for two weeks to make the changes they've always dreamed of.In every company, bosses struggle to find ways to think outside the box and keep their companies profitable while workers fantasise about what they would do if they were in charge. The Takeover challenges both boss and staff to put their money where their mouth is!But what happens when the employees encounter the harsh realities of running a business? How do shop floor staff cope with life in top level management? And does it breathe new life into the company - or do the lunatics end up running the asylum?\n"
