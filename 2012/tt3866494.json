Chung Man-Ching (Zaizai Lin) was abandoned at birth but had the good fortune of being raised by three moms who found her and gave her all the love, support and encouragement any child could need. But despite growing up a confident woman, Man-Ching has always longed for a father figure, and she is elated when the wise Cheng Ta-Shan (Shih-Sian Wang) enters her life to provide counsel during a difficult time in her life. When Man-Ching meets Ta-Shan's withdrawn son, Cheng Yu-En (Morning Tzu-Yi Mo), she is gradually won over by his pure love for her, although she in turn is more drawn to his father's affections and attention. Can Man-Ching help repair the broken father-son relationship or will her love drive the two men further apart?",
