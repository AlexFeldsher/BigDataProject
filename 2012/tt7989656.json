            "The Adventures of Hero-Man(formerly the spin-off of the \"Wii-Pals Cartoon Show\"), follows the adventures of the \"Heroic Combo\": Hero-Man and Sidekick Kid as they battle bad guys; from Pirates, to Pumpkins, to Reptiles and Robots.In Season 1(as a spin-off), Hero-Man and Sidekick Kid take on a lot of randomness, until the \"Un-Good Gang\" makes it's presence known in the City(formerly referred to as \"n00b York\"). Led by the evil Dr. Julius Servo, former \"mentor\" of Sidekick Kid(who was brainwashed by darkness to becoming \"KID SHADOW\"), along with Pumpkin Head, Captain Patches, and Ice-Guy. Other baddies pop in, including Big Cluck(a mascot to the \"Big Cluck'in Hut\" fast food chain), a pair of tiny Twins, and a couple Robots. Season 1 ends with the \"Hero-Man MOVIE\", in which Sidekick Kid has to return to the \"Fortress of Bad-Things\", and take out Dr. Servo, save Hero-Man, and keep from becoming KID SHADOW again.In Season 2(still on-going), the Heroic Combo returns, this time with a new threat to the City looming overhead: The Repscalians of Nashar, led by the evil Lord Skarn, and his 2nd-in-Command, Commander Cazz. An endless army of reptile drones are marching through the City, which strikes a nerve with Sidekick Kid, as his past comes back, and his true path Pico Bellamere, a Nasharian survivor. As Lord Skarn looks to control the City, and take out Sidekick Kid, Hero-Man is coming to terms with his own past. His lost love, Angel Stargazer, and his family that has been gone for years. Meanwhile, a pair of others from the Iglesian Order arrive in the City: Yash-Ti, Pico Bellamere's \"teacher\" on Nashar, and Frostbite, from the world of Hetalia, who's seeking his own revenge on Skarn.Season 2 will continue in 2018..."
