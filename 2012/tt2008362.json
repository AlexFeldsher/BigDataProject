Her amazing talent comes to the attention of Hollywood music producer Danny P., who brings Jadagrace and her BBF Ashley out to Hollywood and promises to make her a star. Danny P. comes through getting Jadagrace her own TV variety show and she's on her way to the big time! Each week is a hilarious \"show within a show\" situation comedy jam packed with music, comedy and magic as Jadagrace, her cast mates and entourage deal with the everyday craziness of a showbiz life for a little kid. What better place than Las Vegas, \"The City Of Entertainment\" for Jadagrace to discover fresh new talent for her show. A hot Teen Pop Star, a Wacky Magician are just a few added to the mix of crazy characters. Throw in some monkeys, tigers, elephants, pigs and horses, and it's a real three ring circus of a show.",
