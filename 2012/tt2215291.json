            "When Reba Gallagher (Reba McEntire) discovers her husband Russell, a country music legend, has a cheatin' heart... her world blows up, right along with the family fortune. Reba dreamt of becoming a country star herself, but put her career on hold to raise a family with Russell. Now, she's questioning all of that, big-time. With the ink on her divorce barely dry, Reba packs up her sharp-tongued mother Shirley (Lily Tomlin), her three kids, and the U-Haul, and heads for sunny California to begin a new chapter. Leaving Nashville in the rear view, they're moving to Malibu, to the last remaining asset they have left - a little beach house. But liberal LaLa Land is quite an adjustment for this traditional Southern Belle. From the Bentleys to the Malibu Barbies, the West Coast seems like the polar opposite of Music City, and Reba feels like an outsider. But with the support of her family, she sets about finding her voice, jump starting her music career, and embracing this chance to begin again. From country music superstar/executive producer Reba McEntire and executive producer Kevin Abbott (Last Man Standing, My Name Is Earl, Reba) comes Reba's return to series television. Malibu Country is a hilarious new comedy about new beginnings that will make your heart sing."
