Due to the fact that he has a teacher's license (since he originally aspired to work as a teacher), the judge presiding in his case orders him to serve a six-month stint as a teacher for underprivileged high school kids in Los Angeles' South Central neighborhood. In doing so, Marcus has to deal with his agent Bobby Gold (Jon Lovitz), who constantly attempts to get his client back into film, when he discovers that Marcus has decided that he wants to remain working at the school and help improve his students. Marcus also deals with the mishaps of his best friends and roommates Tony (Tony T. Roberts) and Jamal (Alex Thomas).",
