            "Qumi-Qumi is a comedy animated series featuring the adventures of the three friends Juga, Yusi and Shumadan. The series was created by the Russian animation studio Toonbox with the help of foreign professionals.The prototypes of Qumi-Qumi were created in 2005 for the comic-strip festival. In 2007, the comic cartoon-song with dancing Qumi-Qumi gained high popularity online with 2 million viewings. It inspired the authors on creating the series and in spring 2011 the pilot episode was ready. The amazing world of Qumi-Qumi in which the scene is set bears a remote resemblance to Earth, however, its flora and fauna hold far more fanciful traits. The Qumi world consists of three tribes which live separately: those are scientists, magicians and the military tribe. Juga, Yusi and Shumadan come from different tribes but get on much better with each other than with their co-tribesmen (who consider them weirdos). In every episode one of the three friends runs into trouble all of them need to clear it up. The fact that both Juga and Shumadan are in love with Yusi doesnt make the situation any easier. The series lacks dialogue, the characters speak the imaginary Qumi language which can be understood by every kid and certain adults. The language is pretty simple, its very easy to learn it. Dynamic plots, crazy adventures and beautiful animation make up for the terseness of the series. The scene is set in an abstract reality. Qumi-Qumi world bears a slight resemblance to Earth reality; however it is notable for fanciful and colorful landscapes and fantastical creatures living in them."
